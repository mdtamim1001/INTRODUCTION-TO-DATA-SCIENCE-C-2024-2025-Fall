"Fewer books sent to schools, education limping on","The boy was pacing the corridor of Ideal School and College in the capital’s Motijheel area. He’s a student of class-VII at this institution. On the 19th day of the academic calendar, he finally received the textbooks provided from the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) on Sunday. However, he received only three (Shoptoborna, Anondopath, and English) out of 13 books prescribed for his class. He said that he has the PDF versions of the books downloaded at home. Another student of class-IX from the English version of the school said he has not received even a single textbook yet. His teachers give lectures in the class taking help of printed copies of the downloaded PDF book. And, he studies from the website at home. A teacher of the school with administrative responsibilities said that they have received and distributed all the primary level textbooks of the Bangla version. At the secondary level, they have provided the students of class-VI with three textbooks, students of class-VIII and IX with two books while the students of tenth graders each received just four textbooks. However, no textbook of the primary or the secondary level for the English version has arrived yet. There are more than 7,000 students studying in the Bangla version at the Mothijheel branch of this school and over 3,000 students in the English version. This is the current state of free textbook distribution at the primary and the secondary levels in this renowned school of Dhaka. However, this institution is not alone; the picture is more or less the same everywhere. Visiting at least 25 schools in all eight divisions of the country, including Dhaka, on behalf of Prothom Alo this Sunday, it was found that in none of those schools did all the classes receive all the new books. Most of the students from class-I to III have received all the books while the fourth to tenth graders are yet to receive most of their books. These students, that too not all of them, have received the Bangla, English, and Mathematics textbooks mostly. In this circumstance, the lessons and studies are going on in a patchy manner. Classes are not being conducted properly and the presence of students is low as well. Some teachers are downloading the PDF versions from the website to teach from that. In some places students are learning from the previous year’s textbooks. Some teachers are teaching from their experience while some schools are teaching basics in the absence of textbooks. Many of the students are also downloading the PDF versions to study. The secondary and higher education division says that it would take till February for all the students to receive the books. However, observing the actual situation at hand it seems that by February it might be possible to distribute all the books of the primary level only. But it might take till March to reach all the books of the secondary level to the students, people involved in the printing business reckon. The new academic year started on 1 January.  According to NCTB sources around 401.5 million textbooks are being printed for about 40 million primary and secondary level students in the new academic year. Of them, more than 90 million textbooks are for the primary level. More than 60 million (6 crore) of those books have been certified in pre-delivery inspection till 18 January. That means more than 65 per cent of these textbooks have been delivered already. Meanwhile, the number of textbooks required on the secondary level (including Ibtedayi from Madrasah) is close to 301 million. As per NCTB sources, more than 62.5 million secondary level textbooks have been delivered up to 18 January while about 95.6 million textbooks have been printed in total. The curriculum has been changed and the textbooks have been revised this year owing to the change of political setting. That is why the printing of the textbooks was delayed. Then there was also delay in completing tasks like calling for tenders, giving approval and signing contracts. Now, printers are also speaking of some issues including shortage of paper and art cards, lack of sufficient binders, and difficulty in taking bank loans. This time, students are suffering delays in receiving books and it’s the fault of both the education division as well as the printers. Speaking about this, NCTB chairman professor AKM Reazul Hassan told Prothom Alo Sunday that they are continuing with their efforts to deliver the books faster. At the initiative of the education adviser and the senior secretary of the secondary and higher education division, they are trying to solve the issues mentioned by the printers. They expect to deliver all the books of the primary level and the ones of class-X within the current month. Meanwhile, the books of class-VI to IX would also be available to students by 15th to 20th of the next month, he added. This correspondent visited four schools in Dhaka city in person Sunday. One of those four schools was Provati Uchya Biddyaniketon in the Eskaton area. One of the teachers there revealed that all the books of class-I, II and III have arrived.  On the other hand they have received three out of six books of class-IV, four books of class-V, three books of class-VI and none of the books of class-VII. Also, only three of the books have arrived for the students of class-VIII, IX and X. They received these books in three installments. Assistant teacher of information and communication technology (ICT) at the school, Syed Abed Ali said that they have not received the ICT textbooks yet. He is conducting lessons from his experience with the help of the website. While visiting the English version of BIAM Laboratory School, it was found that the textbooks for students up to class-III arrived on Thursday while the books of class-IV and V are yet to be received. Students are taught up to class-VIII at the Ideal Government Primary School in Motijheel. All the textbooks have been distributed among students up to class-V at this school. Meanwhile, they have received three books each for class-VI and VIII and none of the books for class-VII. Students of class-V and VIII at Nasirabad Government Boys’ High School in Chattogram city have not received any of their textbooks yet. Students of class-VI and VII have received three books each while students of class-IX and X have received seven, a few more than them. One of the teachers at the school told Prothom Alo that classes have been going on irregularly in the absence of books. Speaking to Prothom Alo, Chattogram district education officer Uttam Khisa said that the demand of the textbooks in the district stands at 17.4 million. Till Sunday afternoon, they received only 3.6 million books. Meanwhile, district primary education officer SM Abdur Rahman said that the demand for primary level textbooks in Chattogram this year stands at over 4 million. About 2.07 million of them have been delivered till Sunday. The demand for books in the pre-primary level is 163,082 but only 95,731 have arrived so far. A student of class-VIII at Uttar Gosaipur High School in Dinajpur Sadar upazila stated that she has received only three out of 11 of her textbooks. Also Garabaria Government Primary School in Kathuli Union of Meherpur district has not received all the books for all the classes yet. Assistant teacher at Belgharia Government Primary School in Durgapur area of Rajshahi, Motalib Mridha said that they are taking classes by downloading the textbooks from online. They are writing the lessons on the board and the students are copying that as much as they can. Head master of Surbala Smriti Bidyapith school in Rangamati Sadar upazila, Arun Kanti Chakma said they have received three books of class-VI, two books of class-VIII and eight books of class-IX so far. They are receiving the books in phases. Fourth and fifth graders at Kakiyachhara Tea Estate Government Primary School in Sreemangal upazila of Moulvibazar district have not received any of their textbooks yet. However, 90 per cent of the books for class-I, II and III have been delivered there. Head master of the school Zuthika Debi said that they are teaching the students of class-IV and V with books from the previous year as they did not receive the new books. However, the presence of students is low because of the absence of new books. Students are usually enthusiastic when they get their hands on the new textbooks.

"Trump signs order to pull US from WHO, citing funding disparities","President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order directing the United States to withdraw from the World Health Organisation (WHO), a body he has repeatedly criticised over its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Speaking at the White House hours after his inauguration, Trump said the United States was paying far more to the UN body compared to China, adding: “World Health ripped us off.” The United States, the largest donor to the Geneva-based organization, provides substantial financial support that is vital to the WHO’s operations. Its withdrawal is expected to trigger a significant restructuring of the institution and could further disrupt global health initiatives. This marks the second time Trump has sought to sever ties with the WHO. During his first term, the United States issued a notice of intent to withdraw, accusing the organization of being overly influenced by China during the pandemic’s early stages. That move was later reversed under former president Joe Biden’s administration. In his new executive order, Trump directed agencies to “pause the future transfer of any United States Government funds, support, or resources to the WHO” and to “identify credible and transparent United States and international partners to assume necessary activities previously undertaken by the WHO.” The administration also announced plans to review and rescind Biden’s 2024 US Global Health Security Strategy, which was designed to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, “as soon as practicable.” The timing of the US withdrawal comes amid mounting fears over the pandemic potential of the current bird flu outbreak (H5N1), which has infected dozens and claimed one life in the United States. Meanwhile, WHO member states have been negotiating the world’s first treaty on pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response since late 2021 -- negotiations now set to proceed without US participation."
"Dhaka greets Trump marking his inauguration","Dhaka Monday extended greetings to Donald Trump who was set to be sworn-in for a second term as president of the United States of America (USA) within a few hours in Washington DC. “Honorable Chief Adviser (Muhammad Yunus) had sent a congratulatory message to Mr. Donald Trump upon his election as the President of the United States. In that message, the Chief Adviser expressed firm belief that both nations would work together to explore new avenues of cooperation,” read a message of Bangladesh foreign ministry that was shared with the media. The message read, “We reaffirm that belief and extend our best wishes to Mr. Donald Trump as he begins his new term.” In a ceremony moved indoors because of bitterly cold weather, Trump will take the oath of office in the Rotunda of the Capitol in Washington DC. “I am delighted to convey, on behalf of the government and the people of Bangladesh, my heartfelt felicitations to you on your victory in the US Presidential Election 2024,” Chief Adviser Professor Muhamamd Yunus said in a congratulatory message to Trump after his win in the US election in November last year. “Electing you as the US President for a second term reflects that your leadership and vision have resonated with the people of the United States of America. I am confident that under your stewardship, the United States will thrive and continue to inspire others around the world,” the message read. Dr Yunus said Bangladesh and the US share a long history of friendship and collaboration across numerous areas of mutual interest. The relationship continued to grow in depth and breadth during Trump’s previous term in the office, he said. The chief adviser said he firmly believes that the possibilities are endless as the two friendly nations work towards exploring newer avenues of partnership."
"Tech billionaires take center stage at Trump inauguration","Tech billionaires including Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were given prime positions at Donald Trump's inauguration Monday, in an unprecedented demonstration of their power and influence on US politics. Musk, Bezos and Zuckerberg are the world's three richest people, according to Forbes. Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who also attended, ranks seventh. US tech tycoons have spent the weeks since the election courting favor with Trump, marking a dramatic shift from Silicon Valley's more hostile response to his first term as president four years ago. Attendees also included Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. TikTok CEO Shou Chew sat in the back row of the stage, even as his platform's future remains uncertain. Trump later in the day ordered a 75-day pause on enforcing a law that would effectively ban TikTok in the United States. Despite highly limited seating after the ceremony was moved indoors due to bad weather, Meta CEO Zuckerberg attended with his wife Priscilla Chan, while Amazon executive chairman Bezos was accompanied by his fiancee, Lauren Sanchez. ""When the three wealthiest men in America sit behind Trump at his inauguration, everyone understands that the billionaire class now controls our government,"" left-wing US Senator Bernie Sanders said in a social media post. The tech titans' prominent positions on the inauguration stage was particularly notable for Zuckerberg, whom Trump had threatened with life imprisonment just months ago. The Meta chief recently made headlines by brashly aligning his company's policies with Trump's conservative worldview, notably by eliminating fact-checking in the United States and relaxing hate speech restrictions on Facebook and Instagram. Musk has shown the strongest support for Trump, spending USD 277 million to help him and other Republicans win November's election while transforming his X platform into an amplifier for pro-Trump voices. Bezos, like Zuckerberg and his peers, has visited Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida leading up to the inauguration, with favorable treatment, government contracts and reduced regulatory scrutiny for Amazon at stake. As owner of The Washington Post, Bezos sparked controversy by blocking the newspaper's planned endorsement of Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris for the 2024 presidential election, triggering newsroom protests and subscriber cancellations. Musk has been named a leader of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency to advise the White House on cuts to public spending and has spent much of the past two months at Mar-a-Lago.  While Musk's SpaceX is already a major government contractor, Amazon's AWS cloud computing division and Google also count the US government among their biggest clients. Google, Meta, Apple and Amazon are also fighting landmark antitrust lawsuits from the US government. ""These are very wealthy people who have basically paid for access, which is something that they would do for any upcoming administration even if we all recognize Trump is very transactional,"" said Andrew Selepak, a media professor at the University of Florida. ""They're making sure it's very clear that their faces, names, and especially their money, is here,"" he added."
"China keen to take Chief Adviser to Beijing in March","Following the 5 August 2024 changeover due to the student-people uprising, China is keen to deepen the relations with Bangladesh. Beijing is interested in a summit meeting in continuation of bilateral meetings with the interim government. That is why China wants to take Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus to China in March this year, marking five decades of diplomatic relations between the two countries. China has already invited Dr Muhammad Yunus to attend the Boao Forum For Asia (BFA), scheduled to be held in Beijing on 27-28 March, diplomatic sources said. The Boao Forum for Asia is a nonprofit platform that hosts high-level forums for leaders from government, business and academia in Asia and other continents to share their vision on the most pressing issues in this region and the world at large. Wishing not to be named, a high level source in the government Sunday evening told this correspondent that China has shown interest for a bilateral summit meeting with the Chief Adviser alongside attending the BFA conference during the visit to  Beijing  Foreign ministry officials said foreign adviser Md Touhid Hossain would leave for China in a bilateral meeting on Monday afternoon. He will hold a bilateral meeting with China Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing on Tuesday. The two will discuss how the relations would move forward. The health sector could get importance in cooperation between the two countries in the coming days. Discussions may be held on setting up a friendship hospital in Bangladesh with the help of China for the first time, ensuring low-cost medical services for Bangladeshi patients in several provinces, including Kunming, as well as on signing several memorandums of understanding (MoUs) on special projects for the care and rehabilitation of injured people in Dhaka. The chief adviser has recently been invited to attend the 25-nation BFA summit in Beijing from 25-28 March. China is interested in organising a discussion between the country’s top leaders, including President Xi Jinping, and Bangladesh’s top leader on the sidelines of the forum meeting. However, wishing not to be named, several foreign ministry officials think that there is uncertainty about the visit in March. State events are organised on 26 March due to Bangladesh’s Independence and National Day. Apart from this, it is also a matter of consideration, whether it is enough to organise a summit meeting just two months after the foreign adviser’s meeting. At the same time, diplomats believe that it is imperative to move cautiously instead of getting close to any country hurriedly due to the tilted policies of the previous government. A diplomatic source told this correspondent that the matter of sending a chartered plane from China to take Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus to Beijing was also mentioned. The source said the issue of the Chief Adviser’s visit to China may come up for discussion during the foreign affairs adviser’s visit to Beijing. Sources said that the issue of giving importance to the health sector in cooperation is expected to be discussed at the foreign minister-level meeting in Beijing Tuesday. Dhaka has proposed to Beijing to sign an MoU to set up a specialised medical and rehabilitation centre with financial and technical assistance from China, especially for the treatment and rehabilitation of those injured in the student uprising. Sources further said that Bangladesh is interested in signing an MoU quickly to construct the first friendship hospital, funded by China, in Purbachal. Bangladesh wants the hospital to be run by skilled physicians and professionals from China. Apart from this, Bangladesh wants China’s cooperation in identifying high-quality hospitals in Kunming and adjacent areas to ensure medical services for Bangladeshi patients. China’s Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen told Prothom Alo Sunday morning, “We agree in principle to establish a hospital in Bangladesh. We are now waiting for a detailed proposal from Bangladesh. We want to know what kind of hospital Bangladesh wants and where this hospital will be constructed.” “We will move forward following a process after receiving a proposal from Bangladesh. We are interested in modernising Bangladesh’s health sector,” he added. The MoU on sustainable management of river water, signed between the two countries in 2016, is scheduled to be renewed during the foreign adviser’s visit. The agreement signed between the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BPDB) and Power China is considered an outline MoU. Discussions are underway between the two countries on the Teesta project in continuation of this MoU. Speaking about the Teesta project, Yao Wen said, “We are interested in assisting Bangladesh in this project. Now it is Bangladesh that will have to decide how to implement it.” Diplomatic sources said the Bangladesh side at the meeting in Beijing will raise the construction of China’s mega dam in upstream of the Brahmaputra River. The country has taken the initiative to construct a dam worth about USD 100 billion in Tibet to generate about 60,000 MW electricity. This has created doubts about the availability of water for downstream countries. India has already expressed concerns over the construction of the dam. The Chinese ambassador met with adviser Touhid Hossain on Sunday morning. Later, speaking about the construction of the dam in Tibet, the ambassador said that the construction will not have any negative impact on the downstream countries. In the foreign minister level bilateral meeting, Bangladesh will put stress on investment, trade and project financing. In addition to reducing the interest rate from 2 per cent to a reasonable level, Dhaka will seek the cancellation of the 0.5 per cent loan commitment fee. The meeting will also discuss important projects, including the procurement of four ships as per the previous agreement, especially the projects for which financing is currently stalled. Dhaka will also seek China’s cooperation on the Rohingya issue. Bangladesh will also urge China to stand by the Rohingyas in the UN Security Council. At the same time, Bangladesh expects more investment from China. After 5 August, China has come forward with an investment of over USD 200 million. The country is also one of the major trading partners of Bangladesh. Dhaka will seek cooperation in free trade of goods and raw materials, including delayed payment. Bangladesh will also seek duty-free and quota-free facilities for Bangladeshi products in the Chinese market for an additional three years after graduating from a low-income country. Asked about the China visit, foreign adviser Md. Touhid Hossain told Prothom Alo, “There will be discussions on advancing cooperation between the two countries, keeping in mind the five-decade anniversary of the relations. Our priority will be economic and development cooperation.” * The report, originally published in the print and online editions of Prothom Alo, has been rewritten in English by Shameem Reza"
"CA leaves Dhaka for Davos to attend WEF","Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus left Dhaka for Davos, Switzerland, at early hours of Tuesday, on a four-day official visit to attend the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF). A flight of Emirates airline carrying Prof Yunus and his entourage left Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at 1:00 am (today), Chief Adviser’s Press Secretary Shafiul Alam told BSS. During his visit, the Chief Adviser is expected to hold bilateral talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Finland President Alexander Stubb, King Philippe of Belgium and Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra. The Chief Adviser will also hold meetings with Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, daughter of Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum; Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank; Sir Nick Clegg, President of Global Affairs at Meta; Dr Agnes Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International, and Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). A separate dialogue on Bangladesh will be held at the World Economic Forum where global business leaders and CEOs of various international organisations will join. The chief adviser is scheduled to return home on 25 January."
"A lost chapter in Bangladesh-Pakistan diplomacy","Bangladesh’s diplomacy is like an old-fashioned wall clock with a pendulum, swinging back and forth. For the past one and a half decades, it had tilted to one side, but now it may be time for a change in direction. In the recent past, relations with many countries were unusually ""good,"" while with others, they deteriorated. Now, efforts are underway to correct these ""abnormal"" chapters. At this time, efforts are also being made to revive the lost communication in the bilateral relationship between Bangladesh and Pakistan. There has been an increase in conversations between diplomats and politicians of both countries. 2024 marks the 50th anniversary of mutual recognition between Bangladesh and Pakistan. This moment is quite a celebratory one. At such a ""favorable moment,"" as efforts are being made to rebuild the relationship, a natural question arises: will the old sensitive issue of Bangladesh's outstanding dues with Pakistan be settled? This is a fundamental unresolved issue in their relationship. European countries have been functioning together in a union for 31 years. Unfortunately, the countries of South Asia have had a different experience. They initially separated into several entities and have not been able to form a union like the EU, nor have they managed to maintain even normal bilateral relations in many cases. Even a small conflict leads to the imposition of stricter visa policies on each other’s citizens. Due to such ""teenage"" mentality, expected commercial and cultural relations have not progressed. The Bangladesh-Pakistan relationship has suffered from similar misfortune. Pakistan’s export business with Bangladesh is less than $100 million, and only one-five-hundredth of Bangladesh’s total exports goes to Pakistan. Though Pakistan is somewhat ahead in this regard, high tariffs from Bangladesh have made it difficult for Pakistani goods to enter the country. Over the years, the flow of goods from Pakistan has been closely monitored as a political decision. For a long time, there have been no direct flights from Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) to Dhaka. Such a situation clearly needs to change. Together, both countries represent a market of over 400 million people. Normal diplomatic relations could open up significant opportunities for both nations. Pakistan could become a good market for Bangladesh's products, ranging from raw jute to pharmaceuticals. Recently, business chambers from both countries have formed a new council to increase trade. However, it is difficult for businessmen alone to smoothen interstate relations; only politicians can do that. To move forward, Bangladesh and Pakistan must address their old debts and unresolved issues. A significant obstacle in the past was the issue of Urdu-speaking people stranded in Bangladesh. Since Bangladesh granted them voting rights, Pakistan is now somewhat freed from this responsibility. The government of Dhaka has shown considerable generosity on this matter, and today’s Urdu-speaking generation is less inclined to move to Pakistan. Another unresolved issue concerns the division of post-independence resources. Although this issue hasn’t been discussed for a long time, it will need resolution to move the relationship forward. From Bangladesh’s perspective, the people have a legitimate claim to these resources, and no policymaker can ignore this demand. Pakistan and Bangladesh were united for 24 years. After their separation, the division of economic responsibilities naturally arose. These include sharing foreign assets, the foreign currency held in Bangladesh before the war, the surplus generated from exports and imports during the period of East Pakistan, and the receipt and repayment of foreign debts. There is also the matter of compensations for the war victims. However, due to the political emotions and tensions following 1971, this crucial task was not carried out dispassionately and remains unresolved. Although 54 years have passed, it is a matter that the leaders of both countries must resolve in one way or another. There are many precedents in international law regarding the division of state legacy after partition, the birth of new states, or the unification of two regions. Bangladesh and Pakistan can take guidance from these conventions to reach a satisfactory resolution on this disputed issue. In December, during the D-8 summit in Egypt, Bangladesh's interim government’s chief advisor, professor Muhammad Yunus, met with Pakistan’s prime minister Shahbaz Sharif. He appropriately mentioned that “old issues keep resurfacing, and to move forward, the unresolved matters must be settled, especially for the sake of future generations.” They had met earlier during the UN General Assembly as well. During Nawaz Sharif’s tenure in the past, Pakistan showed the most positive attitude toward bilateral issues. In this light, it can be said that now is a good moment for both countries to move forward in their relations. This is also an opportunity. Since independence, many Bangladeshi politicians and intellectuals have called for the settlement of old debts. During the war, Pakistan had reserves of about $4.25 billion, part of which many have claimed should be Bangladesh's share. In 1972, then prime minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman raised claims on this issue. During Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s visit in 1974, formal discussions on these debts took place, with Bangladesh presenting a claim for $4 billion.Later, Bhutto suggested that Bangladesh should also share the foreign debts from before 1971. Even though this was a negative approach, it acknowledged the rationale behind the division of assets, and Bangladesh agreed to take on a part of undivided Pakistan’s foreign debt, amounting to around $360 million. Under pressure from creditors, Bangladesh agreed to this decision. Bangladesh was positive from the beginning about advancing relations with Pakistan. However, Bangladesh’s acceptance of foreign debt from undivided Pakistan was related to the financial division at that time, and a resolution would need to come in a package. Although discussions on debts were halted after 1975, in 1978, Shamsul Haq, the foreign minister of Ziaur Rahman’s government, also raised the matter. While the Pakistani government initially remained silent on this issue, later Pakistan’s businessmen began raising concerns about compensating for their abandoned businesses in Bangladesh. This added complexity to the issue of state legacy. However, there are many elements worth listening to in the views of Pakistan’s industrialists and businessmen. The Bangladeshi government later took some corrective actions in response. But the Pakistani government has always been unwilling and unclear in addressing the state legacy of debts, and at times has used the issue of assets abandoned during the war to deflect attention from the matter. Such conflicting claims are an obstacle to healthy bilateral relations. What is needed is a solution where both sides can make concessions and receive something in return. Expectations are high that Pakistan’s foreign minister’s upcoming visit to Bangladesh will lead to positive progress on this matter. It is true that after the war, many industrial assets of West Pakistan were nationalised in Bangladesh. The Karachi Stock Exchange later made a record of these industries. For such assets, there is a need for extensive research to determine whether the post-war government in Bangladesh managed these properties correctly, how they were distributed, and where these assets are now. For many, this may seem like opening a Pandora’s Box, but avoiding the responsibilities of history is truly difficult. What could have started in 1972, is still an issue that cannot be avoided in 2025. At least, if relations with Pakistan are to progress, these matters will inevitably come to the fore. Even if governments try to avoid them, questions may be raised by non-governmental entities, and if avoided entirely, they could emerge in international forums. In the past, the return of Urdu-speaking people and the issue of war crimes overshadowed Bangladesh-Pakistan bilateral talks. Now that Bangladesh is handling the issue of Urdu speakers on its own terms, Pakistan may come up with positive proposals regarding the settlement of debts. Even if both countries feel embarrassed to discuss these matters directly, they could seek technical assistance from the UN or the OIC. Such initiatives would speed up potential commercial, diplomatic, and geopolitical cooperation. However, current efforts to normalize relations should not be held back by the division of debts. Bangladesh has already taken steps to import 50,000 metric tons of rice from Pakistan, among other goods, signaling an expansion of bilateral ties. Nevertheless, any normal relationship requires a transparent understanding of past wrongs. The future’s sustainability depends on past justice. In particular, the international assistance sent to East Pakistan during the November 1970 cyclone, which was not distributed due to the outbreak of war four months later (amounting to nearly $200 million), could serve as an immediate and inspiring precedent for Pakistan. In recent history, relations couldn't be continued even after elevating bilateral relations with India to great heights due to the unresolved Teesta water-sharing issue. Unresolved economic issues from before 1971 will inevitably resurface in the Bangladesh-Pakistan relationship. People might even wonder: if water-sharing can become an international issue, why not economic debts? **Altaf Parvez is a researcher on history **This column appeared in the print and online edition of Prothom Alo and has been rewritten for the English edition by Rabiul Islam"
"Medical admission postponed for candidates passed under quota, docs to be scrutinised","The documents of children of freedom fighters and underprivileged communities who passed the MBBS admission test under quota facilities for the 2024-25 education session will be scrutinised. If any of their information are found to be incorrect, their primary selection will be cancelled, the Directorate General of Medical Education (DGME) said on Monday. The admission procedure for the 193 students passed under the quota facilities will remain postponed until the completion of this scrutiny. However, the activities will continue for all other candidates. As per the provisions, there is a 5 per cent quota for the children of freedom fighters, martyred freedom fighters and Birangonas (war heroines). Besides, there is a 5 per cent reservation for the underprivileged communities. The MBBS admission test results were published on Sunday. But the students of several medical colleges, including the Dhaka Medical College, and university students have been staging demonstrations for the last two days, demanding republishing the results, scrapping the MBBS admission test results published on Sunday, and to do away with the quota system in the medical admission test. They submitted a memo for Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus around 3:00 pm today, Monday. They demanded the medical admission test results to be cancelled by 8:00 pm today and republish it. In this context, a notification of DGME today said their policy states that the documents of candidates passed under the quota facilities for the freedom fighters, martyred freedom fighters, war heroines and underprivileged communities will be scrutinised by the by the central admission committee and the admission process, subject to permission, will have to be completed. The candidates passed under the quota facilities for the underprivileged communities have been asked to remain present at the DGME with necessary documents on 23 and 26 January. Besides, the candidates passed under the quota facilities for the freedom fighters, martyred freedom fighters, and war heroines have been asked to show their documents at the DGME on 27, 28 and 29 January. DGME’s additional director general (medical education) Professor Rubina Yasmin told Prothom Alo the policy states about a 5 per cent quota for the children of freedom fighters, martyred freedom fighters, and war heroines. There will be none under this quota if the government takes a decision that this quota will no longer be in place. She further said, if the government decides to retain the quota, then the children of freedom fighters, martyred freedom fighters, and war heroines with valid documents will be selected. The remaining seats will be filled from the merit list."
"Trump pardons 1,500 defendants of 6 Jan, exits climate pact, doubles down on fossil fuel","Donald Trump pardoned about 1,500 of his supporters who attacked the US Capitol four years ago as he moved swiftly to impose his will on the US government just hours after reclaiming the presidency on Monday. After a day of ceremony, Trump signed a series of executive actions to curb immigration and roll back environmental regulations and racial and gender diversity initiatives. He did not take immediate action to raise tariffs, a key campaign promise, but said he could impose 25% duties on Canada and Mexico on 1 February. His decision to pardon supporters who attacked the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, is sure to enrage police, lawmakers and others whose lives were put at risk during an unprecedented episode in modern US history. Roughly 140 police officers were assaulted during the attack, with some sprayed with chemical irritants and others struck with pipes, poles and other weapons. Four people died during the chaos, including a Trump supporter who was shot dead by police. Among those covered by the order were leaders of the far-right Oath Keepers and Proud Boys militant groups, who were serving long prison sentences. Earlier in the day, Trump, 78, took the oath of office in the Capitol Rotunda, where a mob of his supporters had rampaged on Jan. 6 in an unsuccessful attempt to reverse his 2020 loss to Joe Biden. At the ceremony, Trump portrayed himself as a savior chosen by God to rescue a faltering nation. His inauguration amounts to a triumphant return for a political disruptor who survived two assassination attempts and won election despite a criminal conviction and a prosecution stemming from his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. “I was saved by God to make America great again,” he said. Trump is the first president in more than a century to win a second term after losing the White House and the first felon to occupy the White House. The oldest president ever to be sworn in, he is backed by Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress. Trump moved quickly to clamp down on illegal immigration, a signature issue since he first entered politics in 2015. Shortly after he took the oath of office, US border authorities shut down a program that allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to enter the US legally by scheduling an appointment through a smartphone. Existing appointments were canceled. At the White House, Trump signed an order that declared a national emergency at the US-Mexico border, which would unlock funding and allow him to dispatch troops there. He signed an order that would end a policy that confers citizenship to those born in the United States, which is certain to trigger a lengthy court fight. Another executive order designated Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organisations. “We’re getting rid of all the cancer ... caused by the Biden administration,” Trump said as he signed a stack of executive orders in the Oval Office. Other orders revoked Biden administration policies governing artificial intelligence and electric vehicles. He also imposed a freeze on federal hiring and ordered government workers to return to the office, rather than working from home. He also signed paperwork to create a “Department of Government Efficiency,” an outside advisory board headed by billionaire Elon Musk that aims to cut large swaths of government spending. In the State Department, more than a dozen nonpartisan senior diplomats were asked to resign as part of a broader plan to replace nonpartisan civil servants with loyalists. He also said he would issue orders to scrap federal diversity programs and require the government to recognise only genders assigned at birth. While Trump sought to portray himself as a peacemaker and unifier during his half-hour speech, his tone was often sharply partisan. He repeated false claims from his campaign that other countries were emptying their prisons into America and voiced familiar grievances over his criminal prosecutions. With Biden seated nearby, Trump issued a stinging indictment of his predecessor’s policies from immigration to foreign affairs. “We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders, but refuses to defend American borders, or more importantly, its own people,” Trump said. Numerous tech executives who have sought to curry favor with the incoming administration - including the three richest men in the world, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg - had prominent seats on stage, next to cabinet nominees and members of Trump’s family. Trump said he would send astronauts to Mars, prompting Musk - who has long talked about colonizing the planet - to raise his fists. Trump vowed to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America and repeated his intention to take back control of the Panama Canal, one of several foreign policy pronouncements that have caused consternation among US allies. Trump took the oath of office to “preserve, protect and defend” the US Constitution at 12:01 p.m. ET (1701 GMT), administered by Chief Justice John Roberts. His vice president, JD Vance, was sworn in just before him. Outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump in November, was seated next to Biden in a section with former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016, sat with her husband Bill. Obama’s wife, Michelle, chose not to attend. The ceremony was moved indoors due to the extreme cold gripping much of the country. Trump skipped Biden’s inauguration and has continued to claim falsely that the 2020 election he lost to Biden was rigged. Biden, in one of his last official acts, pardoned several people whom Trump has threatened with retaliation, including General Mark Milley, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who Trump has suggested should be executed for holding back-channel talks with China. Milley’s portrait was removed from the Pentagon shortly after Trump’s inauguration. He also pardoned five family members minutes before leaving office, citing fears that Trump would target them."

"US renews pledge to support Bangladesh's interim govt","The new Charge d'affaires of the US embassy in Dhaka Tracey Ann Jacobson Monday reiterated the support of her country for the Interim Government of Bangladesh on various issues, including development and counter-terrorism. ""We are prepared as a nation to support your government on a variety of issues,"" Jacobson told Chief Adviser professor Muhammad Yunus as she called on him at the State Guest House Jamuna in Dhaka. The Chief Adviser spoke about the ongoing reform initiatives in Bangladesh, the government's efforts to build a political consensus on the July proclamation and the plan for the next general election. Regarding the July proclamation, Dr Yunus said he was expecting the political parties to reach a consensus by early February. ""So far I have not heard any dissenting voices,"" he said, calling the political exercise to build the consensus on the issue a ""tough"" one and added that the theme of the proposed proclamation is ""unity."" The Chief Adviser said the government will only play the role of a facilitator. ""My job is building a consensus. I am not pushing any idea,"" he said. He said once the political parties agreed to the reform proposals, the government would request them to sign it to create a July Charter. ""We don't know whether the contents will contain many items or a few items,"" he told the US envoy. ""It's a tough job given the varieties of opinion we have. But the process has started. Once signed, our politics will be based on the July Charter,"" he added. The US Charge d'affaires raised concerns over the arrest of some journalists and reports of some violence against religious minorities. The Chief Adviser said his government is committed to ensuring justice for everyone in the country. During the hour-long meeting, they also discussed Dhaka's ties with its neighbours, progress on resolving the Rohingya crisis, and the security situation in Myanmar. The Chief Adviser said Bangladesh values its relationship with all neighbours. ""That's how the idea of SAARC came about, and we are the initiator of it,"" he said, highlighting his recent moves to revive SAARC and transform it into a platform like the European Union. He thanked the US for providing humanitarian assistance to Rohingya refugees and sought the country's support for the repatriation of the Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh and creating a safe zone for the displaced people in Myanmar's Rakhine State. The Chief Adviser mentioned that Bangladesh is a top importer of US cotton and urged the country to import more apparel and textiles, which would mean a greater import of US cotton. Lamiya Morshed, senior secretary to SDG affairs, was also present on the occasion."
"Police, RAB, Ansar to get new uniforms","The interim government has decided to change the uniforms of Bangladesh Police, Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and Bangladesh Ansar. Home Adviser Lieutenant General (retired) Md Jahangir Alam Chowdhury disclosed this at a press conference after a meeting of the advisory council committee on law and order at the Secretariat on Monday. Social Welfare Adviser Sharmeen Murshid and Special Assistant to Chief Adviser Khuda Baksh Chowdhury were also present at the event. A demand for reform to police rose after the fall of the Awami League government through the student-people uprising on 5 August. Demand for a change to police uniform also came to limelight. Replying to query on the reasons to change the uniforms of police, RAB and Ansar, the home adviser said it is necessary to change everyone’s mind-set and that is why uniforms of police, RAB, Ansar are going to be changed. It was revealed at the press conference that iron will the colour of police uniforms, olive for RAB and golden wheat for Ansar uniforms. Replying to query, the home adviser said the uniforms will be changed gradually. Police training will have to be changed to make the agency pro-people."
"What we know about Trump’s planned executive orders after swearing-in","Donald Trump plans to issue a flurry of executive orders and directives after he is sworn in as US president on Monday to put his stamp on his new administration on matters ranging from energy to immigration. Two sources familiar with the planning said more than 100 such orders and directives could be released starting on Day One in what is known internally as a ""shock and awe"" effort. Here is what we know about the executive orders so far: Trump plans to take a flurry of executive actions aimed at cracking down on legal and illegal immigration and ramping up deportations after he enters the White House on Monday, an incoming Trump administration official said. Trump intends to declare illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border a national emergency to support the construction of a border wall and send additional troops to the border, the official said. Trump will issue a sweeping proclamation that aims to block access to all asylum at the Mexico border, the official said. He will also issue an order intended to end birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children whose parents lack legal immigration status, the official said. Citing the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the official said in a briefing: ""The federal government will not recognize automatic birthright citizenship for children of illegal aliens born in the United States. We are also going to enhance vetting and screening of illegal aliens."" The U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment provides for granting citizenship to ""all persons born or naturalized in the United States."" Any move by Trump to end birthright citizenship would face a legal challenge. One of Trump's orders on Monday will declare a national energy emergency aimed at ""unleashing affordable and reliable American energy,"" an official with the incoming White House said. Trump, who vowed during his campaign to ""drill, baby, drill,"" will also sign an executive order focused on Alaska, the official said, adding that the state was critical to U.S. national security and could allow exports of LNG to other parts of the United States and allies. Sources familiar with the plans of members of Trump's transition team have said that Trump is considering executive orders to target everything from electric vehicles to withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, an action he took in his first administration. Members of his transition team are recommending sweeping changes to cut off support for electric vehicles and charging stations and to strengthen measures blocking the import of cars, components and battery materials from China, according to a document seen by Reuters. The transition team also recommends imposing tariffs on all battery materials globally, a bid to boost U.S. production, and then negotiating individual exemptions with allies, the document shows. Trump's executive orders will also likely seek to roll back Biden's climate regulations on power plants, end his pause on liquefied natural gas exports, and revoke waivers allowing California and other states to have tighter pollution rules. Trump will issue a broad trade memo on Monday that stops short of imposing new tariffs on his first day in office, but rather directs federal agencies to evaluate U.S. trade relationships with China, Canada and Mexico, an incoming Trump administration official said. The Republican incoming president has pledged tariffs of 10% on global imports, 60 per cent on Chinese goods and a 25 per cent import surcharge on Canadian and Mexican products, duties that may upend trade flows, raise costs and draw retaliation. The official, confirming a Wall Street Journal report, said Trump will direct agencies to investigate and remedy persistent trade deficits and address unfair trade and currency policies by other nations. The memo will single out China, Canada and Mexico for scrutiny but will not announce new tariffs, the official said. It will direct agencies to assess Beijing's compliance with its 2020 trade deal with the U.S., as well as the status of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, the official said. Trump believes tariffs would help boost economic growth in the United States, although opponents warn that the costs would likely be passed along to consumers. Trump will issue an executive order proclaiming that the U.S. federal government will only recognize two sexes, male and female, an incoming White House official said on Monday. Trump has vowed to sign an executive order ending transgender rights in the U.S. military and inside U.S. schools. As for transgender athletes, he told a rally on Sunday that he would act on his first day to stop the participation of trans athletes in women's sports. Trump will also issue an order ending ""radical and wasteful"" diversity, equity and inclusion programs inside the federal government, an incoming White House official said on Monday. During his first term, Trump signed an executive order to curtail efforts to address racial disparities in the workplace, through programs including diversity training inside companies. Biden reversed that executive order on his first day in office in January 2021, and Trump is likely to reinstate his original order early in his second term, and perhaps on his first day in office. Trump has also criticized ""diversity, equity and inclusion"" policies inside universities. Trump has also said he will take action immediately on taking office to issue pardons for some of the hundreds of people convicted or charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters. Trump said in a campaign video in 2023 that on his first day in office he would revoke the Biden administration's policies that provide information and resources to those seeking medical care so they can align their bodies with the gender they identify with. That care can include hormone therapy and surgery. Trump plans to classify drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations in an early executive order, Punchbowl News reported on Sunday, fulfilling a promise he made on the campaign trail to crack down on the sources of the lethal opioid fentanyl. Trump has railed against work-from-home arrangements for tens of thousands of federal employees, which were greatly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and he has vowed to end them. In December, Trump said if federal workers refuse to return to the office, “they’re going to be dismissed.” By forcing government workers back into the office Trump and his allies hope it could trigger large-scale resignations, which would assist in their goal of reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy."
"Dipu Moni writes on a tissue for 5 minutes in court","It was 9:05am this morning (Monday). A large blue prison van drove up to the gates of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrates (CMM) court, whistles blowing loudly. Former education minister Dipu Moni emerged from the van. Women police escorted her into the court custody room. Former member of parliament Haji Salim and others had already been brought earlier in the morning. Around 30 minutes after Dipu Moni arrived, Haji Salim was brought out by police. He was wearing a loose white panjabi. Haji Salim smiled broadly at the press, while the police held him by the arms on either side. Behind Haji Salim emerged former information and communication technology state minister Zunaid Ahmed Palak. After that, one after the other former law minister Anisul Huq, adviser to the former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, Salman F Rahman, Bangladesh Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon, Jatiya Samajtanktrik Dal (JASAD) president and former minister Hasanul Haque Inu and other were brought to the court room on the third floor of the CMM court. The lawyers of the accused were waiting there from beforehand. The judge came towards the court room at 9:40 am. A glum Haji Salim was placed in the dock and he started shouting. At one point the police asked that he be shown arrested in a murder case at the capital’s Jatrabari police station. Haji Salim’s legal counsel Pran Nath Roy appealed to the court to grant his client bail. He said his client could not speak and was unwell. He was arrested and put in jail for a long time. He had been at the Keraniganj central jail and received first division facilities as a member of parliament. However, he had recently been transferred to the Kashimpur jail. Lawyer Pran Nath Roy went on to tell the court that his client was not receiving any division facilities at the Kashimpur prison. The prison authorities did not understand Haji Salim’s words. He was facing a lot of problems there, The lawyer said his client would be much benefitted if the court granted him division. Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge Court public prosecutor (PP) Omar Faruqui opposed the bail appeal. After hearing both sides, the court rejected the bail appeal. The court ordered to show him as arrested and send him to jail. It was 10:00 am and in the crowded court room the hearing was on for the remand petition in two cases against Anisul Huq, Salman F Rahman and others. Dipu Moni was standing in the dock at the time. In front of her was former member of parliament ABM Fazle Karim Chowdhury. Standing to her left was Hasanul Haque Inu. At one point, Dipu Moni began writing with a pen in her right hand on a tissue in her left hand. Dipu Moni continued writing her “letter” for almost five minutes and then handed it over to a person in lawyer's garb standing in front of the dock. He kept the tissue folded in his left hand and indicated to Dipu that's he's take a picture of it. After handing over the letter, Dipu Moni started talking to Zunaid Ahmed. Dipu Moni was also seen smilingly talking to Salman F Rahman. Public prosecutor Omar Faruq Faruqui told Prothom Alo that he was taking part in the hearing and the dock was at a distance from there. There were many lawyers in the court and he had not spotted the matter of Dipu Moni writing a letter. If he had seen it, he would certainly have brought the matter to the court’s attention. After all, an accused is in custody of the court and cannot speak to anyone other than his or her lawyer. Speaking to Prothom Alo, Dipu Moni’s lawyer Gazi Faisal Islam told Prothom Alo that he had not seen his client write any such letter as the court was crowded and he had been in the front of the court, busy with the hearing. The court ordered Dipu Moni to be shown arrested in two murder cases at the Jatrabari police station and sent to jail. It was seen in court that when Anisul Huq was brought into the court room, he held his two hands in front. He stood gloomily in the dock. He only spoke for some time with his lawyer. After that he stood silent in the dock. Salman F Rahman was by his side but he did not talk to him. Former IGPs Shahidul Huq and Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun stood close by Anisul Huq. They spoke to each other for 5-10 minutes. Rashed Khan Menon was on one side of the dock and standing at a distance from him was Hasanul Haque Inu. They did not speak to each other. They spoke to their lawyers. After the hearing, the court granted permission to take Anisul Huq, Salman F Rahman, Hasanul Haque Inu, Rashed Khan Menon and Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun on remand for a varying number of days. Also, Zunaid Ahmed, Fazle Karim Chowdhury and Shahidul Huq were shown arrested in various cases."
"Giasuddin Al Mamun acquitted in arms case","The High Court on Monday acquitted Giasuddin Al Mamun, a businessman and close friend of BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, in an arms case. The HC bench of Justice Mustafa Zaman Islam and Justice Nasreen Akter passed the order after hearing a petition. Senior Barrister Syed Ahmed stood for Mamun. Mamun was arrested on January 30 in 2007 and was released from prison on August 6, 2024. Twenty cases were filed against Mamun on charges of his alleged involvement in corruption, extortion, money laundering and tax evasion. On 26 March 2007, a case was filed against him under the Arms Act. On 3 July 2007, the court sentenced him to 10 years imprisonment in the case. A petition was filed with the High Court challenging the verdict."
"Anisul, Salman, Inu, Menon and Mamun on remand again","The court has granted permission for former law minister Anisul Huq, Bangladesh Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon and Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal president Hasanul Haque Inu to be taken on 10 days remand in two murder cases filed at the Jatrabari police station. Permission was also granted by the court to take on remand for interrogation Salman F Rahman, former private investment and industries advisor to the prime minister, and Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun on remand, former Inspector General of Police (IGP). Following an appeal from the police, the Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) court issued the order today, Monday. Salman F Rahman and Anisul Huq were arrested on 13 August last year after the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government in face of the student-mass uprising. Rashed Khan Menon was arrested on 22 August and Hasanul Haque Inu on 26 August. Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun was arrested on 3 September.

According to police and court sources, police took Anisul, Salman, Menon, Inu and Mamun to court in the Zeeshan killing case filed at Jatrabari police station and sought 10 days' remand. In the meantime, the police has sought to take Anisul, Menon and Inu on 10 days' demand in the case pertaining to the murder of journalist Mehdi Hasan. Meanwhile, the lawyers of Anisul and others appealed for a rejection of the remand appeal. After hearing both sides, the court granted 10 days for Anisul, Menon and Inu to be taken on 10 days' remand, five days each for two separate murder cases. The court also granted five days remand each for Salman and Mamun to be questioned in a killing case.

Earlier today, Monday, they were taken from jail to the court. At 9:30pm they were placed in court."
"Biden pre-emptively pardons Trump foes","US President Joe Biden on Monday issued pre-emptive pardons to former Covid-19 advisor Anthony Fauci and retired general Mark Milley to shield them from “politically motivated prosecutions” under the Trump administration. In an extraordinary move in his last hours in the White House, Biden gave similar pardons to members, staff and witnesses of a US House committee probing the violent 6 January 2021 US Capitol attack by Donald Trump’s supporters. “These public servants have served our nation with honor and distinction and do not deserve to be the targets of unjustified and politically motivated prosecutions,” Biden said in a statement. “These are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing.” Trump, who will be sworn in on Monday, has repeatedly promised “retribution” against his political opponents and threatened some with criminal prosecution. Fauci became the face of the country’s fight against the Covid pandemic, but his straight-talking takes on the disease in Trump’s first term brought him into conflict with the Republican. It also turned the scientist into a hate figure for many on the right, including Elon Musk, Trump’s ally and the world’s richest man, who repeatedly called for Fauci to be prosecuted. Trump was enraged after Milley, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during Trump’s first term, told journalist Bob Woodward that Trump was “fascist to the core” and “the most dangerous person to this country.” Milley also revealed that he had secretly called his Chinese counterpart after the Capitol attack to reassure Beijing that the United States remained “stable” and had no intention to attack China. Trump subsequently wrote on his Truth Social network that “in times gone by, the punishment would have been DEATH!” for Milley. The members of the January 6 committee meanwhile include fierce Trump critic and former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, the daughter of former vice-president Dick Cheney. “Baseless and politically motivated investigations wreak havoc on the lives, safety, and financial security of targeted individuals and their families,” wrote Biden. The Democrat added that the pardons “should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense.” Trump has repeatedly complained of being the victim of “lawfare” under the Biden administration, after being criminally prosecuted for offenses including trying to subvert the 2020 election."
"Govt to buy sound grenades, teargas shells for BGB to use at border: Home Adviser ","The government has decided to procure sound grenades and teargas shells for the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) to use at the border. Home Adviser Lieutenant General (retired) Md Jahangir Alam Chowdhury disclosed this at a press conference after a meeting of the advisory council committee on law and order at the Secretariat on Monday. The home adviser said India’s Border Security Force (BSF) was seen using sound grenades and teargas shells along the Bangladesh-India border in Chapainawabganj recently, but BGB does not possess any sound grenades and teargas shells. They only possess lethal weapons. In this situation, a decision has been taken to procure sound grenades and teargas shells for the BGB and they will use those when the situation demands, he added. The home adviser further said the border, however, remains calm now. Referring to the stay of illegal immigrants in Bangladesh, adviser Jahangir Alam said many foreigners have been living in Bangladesh illegally as their visa expired. However, the number of illegal immigrants decreased to 33,638 from 49,226 and the government earned Tk 100 million from the application fees to legalise their stay, he added. Those who helped immigrants stay illegally in the country will face action, Jahangir Alam warned."
"Fewer books sent to schools, education limping on","The boy was pacing the corridor of Ideal School and College in the capital’s Motijheel area. He’s a student of class-VII at this institution. On the 19th day of the academic calendar, he finally received the textbooks provided from the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) on Sunday. However, he received only three (Shoptoborna, Anondopath, and English) out of 13 books prescribed for his class. He said that he has the PDF versions of the books downloaded at home. Another student of class-IX from the English version of the school said he has not received even a single textbook yet. His teachers give lectures in the class taking help of printed copies of the downloaded PDF book. And, he studies from the website at home. A teacher of the school with administrative responsibilities said that they have received and distributed all the primary level textbooks of the Bangla version. At the secondary level, they have provided the students of class-VI with three textbooks, students of class-VIII and IX with two books while the students of tenth graders each received just four textbooks. However, no textbook of the primary or the secondary level for the English version has arrived yet. There are more than 7,000 students studying in the Bangla version at the Mothijheel branch of this school and over 3,000 students in the English version. This is the current state of free textbook distribution at the primary and the secondary levels in this renowned school of Dhaka. However, this institution is not alone; the picture is more or less the same everywhere. Visiting at least 25 schools in all eight divisions of the country, including Dhaka, on behalf of Prothom Alo this Sunday, it was found that in none of those schools did all the classes receive all the new books. Most of the students from class-I to III have received all the books while the fourth to tenth graders are yet to receive most of their books. These students, that too not all of them, have received the Bangla, English, and Mathematics textbooks mostly. In this circumstance, the lessons and studies are going on in a patchy manner. Classes are not being conducted properly and the presence of students is low as well. Some teachers are downloading the PDF versions from the website to teach from that. In some places students are learning from the previous year’s textbooks. Some teachers are teaching from their experience while some schools are teaching basics in the absence of textbooks. Many of the students are also downloading the PDF versions to study. The secondary and higher education division says that it would take till February for all the students to receive the books. However, observing the actual situation at hand it seems that by February it might be possible to distribute all the books of the primary level only. But it might take till March to reach all the books of the secondary level to the students, people involved in the printing business reckon. The new academic year started on 1 January.  According to NCTB sources around 401.5 million textbooks are being printed for about 40 million primary and secondary level students in the new academic year. Of them, more than 90 million textbooks are for the primary level. More than 60 million (6 crore) of those books have been certified in pre-delivery inspection till 18 January. That means more than 65 per cent of these textbooks have been delivered already. Meanwhile, the number of textbooks required on the secondary level (including Ibtedayi from Madrasah) is close to 301 million. As per NCTB sources, more than 62.5 million secondary level textbooks have been delivered up to 18 January while about 95.6 million textbooks have been printed in total. The curriculum has been changed and the textbooks have been revised this year owing to the change of political setting. That is why the printing of the textbooks was delayed. Then there was also delay in completing tasks like calling for tenders, giving approval and signing contracts. Now, printers are also speaking of some issues including shortage of paper and art cards, lack of sufficient binders, and difficulty in taking bank loans. This time, students are suffering delays in receiving books and it’s the fault of both the education division as well as the printers. Speaking about this, NCTB chairman professor AKM Reazul Hassan told Prothom Alo Sunday that they are continuing with their efforts to deliver the books faster. At the initiative of the education adviser and the senior secretary of the secondary and higher education division, they are trying to solve the issues mentioned by the printers. They expect to deliver all the books of the primary level and the ones of class-X within the current month. Meanwhile, the books of class-VI to IX would also be available to students by 15th to 20th of the next month, he added. This correspondent visited four schools in Dhaka city in person Sunday. One of those four schools was Provati Uchya Biddyaniketon in the Eskaton area. One of the teachers there revealed that all the books of class-I, II and III have arrived.  On the other hand they have received three out of six books of class-IV, four books of class-V, three books of class-VI and none of the books of class-VII. Also, only three of the books have arrived for the students of class-VIII, IX and X. They received these books in three installments. Assistant teacher of information and communication technology (ICT) at the school, Syed Abed Ali said that they have not received the ICT textbooks yet. He is conducting lessons from his experience with the help of the website. While visiting the English version of BIAM Laboratory School, it was found that the textbooks for students up to class-III arrived on Thursday while the books of class-IV and V are yet to be received. Students are taught up to class-VIII at the Ideal Government Primary School in Motijheel. All the textbooks have been distributed among students up to class-V at this school. Meanwhile, they have received three books each for class-VI and VIII and none of the books for class-VII. Students of class-V and VIII at Nasirabad Government Boys’ High School in Chattogram city have not received any of their textbooks yet. Students of class-VI and VII have received three books each while students of class-IX and X have received seven, a few more than them. One of the teachers at the school told Prothom Alo that classes have been going on irregularly in the absence of books. Speaking to Prothom Alo, Chattogram district education officer Uttam Khisa said that the demand of the textbooks in the district stands at 17.4 million. Till Sunday afternoon, they received only 3.6 million books. Meanwhile, district primary education officer SM Abdur Rahman said that the demand for primary level textbooks in Chattogram this year stands at over 4 million. About 2.07 million of them have been delivered till Sunday. The demand for books in the pre-primary level is 163,082 but only 95,731 have arrived so far. A student of class-VIII at Uttar Gosaipur High School in Dinajpur Sadar upazila stated that she has received only three out of 11 of her textbooks. Also Garabaria Government Primary School in Kathuli Union of Meherpur district has not received all the books for all the classes yet. Assistant teacher at Belgharia Government Primary School in Durgapur area of Rajshahi, Motalib Mridha said that they are taking classes by downloading the textbooks from online. They are writing the lessons on the board and the students are copying that as much as they can. Head master of Surbala Smriti Bidyapith school in Rangamati Sadar upazila, Arun Kanti Chakma said they have received three books of class-VI, two books of class-VIII and eight books of class-IX so far. They are receiving the books in phases. Fourth and fifth graders at Kakiyachhara Tea Estate Government Primary School in Sreemangal upazila of Moulvibazar district have not received any of their textbooks yet. However, 90 per cent of the books for class-I, II and III have been delivered there. Head master of the school Zuthika Debi said that they are teaching the students of class-IV and V with books from the previous year as they did not receive the new books. However, the presence of students is low because of the absence of new books. Students are usually enthusiastic when they get their hands on the new textbooks.

"Trump signs order to pull US from WHO, citing funding disparities","President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order directing the United States to withdraw from the World Health Organisation (WHO), a body he has repeatedly criticised over its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Speaking at the White House hours after his inauguration, Trump said the United States was paying far more to the UN body compared to China, adding: “World Health ripped us off.” The United States, the largest donor to the Geneva-based organization, provides substantial financial support that is vital to the WHO’s operations. Its withdrawal is expected to trigger a significant restructuring of the institution and could further disrupt global health initiatives. This marks the second time Trump has sought to sever ties with the WHO. During his first term, the United States issued a notice of intent to withdraw, accusing the organization of being overly influenced by China during the pandemic’s early stages. That move was later reversed under former president Joe Biden’s administration. In his new executive order, Trump directed agencies to “pause the future transfer of any United States Government funds, support, or resources to the WHO” and to “identify credible and transparent United States and international partners to assume necessary activities previously undertaken by the WHO.” The administration also announced plans to review and rescind Biden’s 2024 US Global Health Security Strategy, which was designed to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, “as soon as practicable.” The timing of the US withdrawal comes amid mounting fears over the pandemic potential of the current bird flu outbreak (H5N1), which has infected dozens and claimed one life in the United States. Meanwhile, WHO member states have been negotiating the world’s first treaty on pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response since late 2021 -- negotiations now set to proceed without US participation."
"Dhaka greets Trump marking his inauguration","Dhaka Monday extended greetings to Donald Trump who was set to be sworn-in for a second term as president of the United States of America (USA) within a few hours in Washington DC. “Honorable Chief Adviser (Muhammad Yunus) had sent a congratulatory message to Mr. Donald Trump upon his election as the President of the United States. In that message, the Chief Adviser expressed firm belief that both nations would work together to explore new avenues of cooperation,” read a message of Bangladesh foreign ministry that was shared with the media. The message read, “We reaffirm that belief and extend our best wishes to Mr. Donald Trump as he begins his new term.” In a ceremony moved indoors because of bitterly cold weather, Trump will take the oath of office in the Rotunda of the Capitol in Washington DC. “I am delighted to convey, on behalf of the government and the people of Bangladesh, my heartfelt felicitations to you on your victory in the US Presidential Election 2024,” Chief Adviser Professor Muhamamd Yunus said in a congratulatory message to Trump after his win in the US election in November last year. “Electing you as the US President for a second term reflects that your leadership and vision have resonated with the people of the United States of America. I am confident that under your stewardship, the United States will thrive and continue to inspire others around the world,” the message read. Dr Yunus said Bangladesh and the US share a long history of friendship and collaboration across numerous areas of mutual interest. The relationship continued to grow in depth and breadth during Trump’s previous term in the office, he said. The chief adviser said he firmly believes that the possibilities are endless as the two friendly nations work towards exploring newer avenues of partnership."
"Tech billionaires take center stage at Trump inauguration","Tech billionaires including Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were given prime positions at Donald Trump's inauguration Monday, in an unprecedented demonstration of their power and influence on US politics. Musk, Bezos and Zuckerberg are the world's three richest people, according to Forbes. Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who also attended, ranks seventh. US tech tycoons have spent the weeks since the election courting favor with Trump, marking a dramatic shift from Silicon Valley's more hostile response to his first term as president four years ago. Attendees also included Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. TikTok CEO Shou Chew sat in the back row of the stage, even as his platform's future remains uncertain. Trump later in the day ordered a 75-day pause on enforcing a law that would effectively ban TikTok in the United States. Despite highly limited seating after the ceremony was moved indoors due to bad weather, Meta CEO Zuckerberg attended with his wife Priscilla Chan, while Amazon executive chairman Bezos was accompanied by his fiancee, Lauren Sanchez. ""When the three wealthiest men in America sit behind Trump at his inauguration, everyone understands that the billionaire class now controls our government,"" left-wing US Senator Bernie Sanders said in a social media post. The tech titans' prominent positions on the inauguration stage was particularly notable for Zuckerberg, whom Trump had threatened with life imprisonment just months ago. The Meta chief recently made headlines by brashly aligning his company's policies with Trump's conservative worldview, notably by eliminating fact-checking in the United States and relaxing hate speech restrictions on Facebook and Instagram. Musk has shown the strongest support for Trump, spending USD 277 million to help him and other Republicans win November's election while transforming his X platform into an amplifier for pro-Trump voices. Bezos, like Zuckerberg and his peers, has visited Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida leading up to the inauguration, with favorable treatment, government contracts and reduced regulatory scrutiny for Amazon at stake. As owner of The Washington Post, Bezos sparked controversy by blocking the newspaper's planned endorsement of Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris for the 2024 presidential election, triggering newsroom protests and subscriber cancellations. Musk has been named a leader of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency to advise the White House on cuts to public spending and has spent much of the past two months at Mar-a-Lago.  While Musk's SpaceX is already a major government contractor, Amazon's AWS cloud computing division and Google also count the US government among their biggest clients. Google, Meta, Apple and Amazon are also fighting landmark antitrust lawsuits from the US government. ""These are very wealthy people who have basically paid for access, which is something that they would do for any upcoming administration even if we all recognize Trump is very transactional,"" said Andrew Selepak, a media professor at the University of Florida. ""They're making sure it's very clear that their faces, names, and especially their money, is here,"" he added."
"China keen to take Chief Adviser to Beijing in March","Following the 5 August 2024 changeover due to the student-people uprising, China is keen to deepen the relations with Bangladesh. Beijing is interested in a summit meeting in continuation of bilateral meetings with the interim government. That is why China wants to take Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus to China in March this year, marking five decades of diplomatic relations between the two countries. China has already invited Dr Muhammad Yunus to attend the Boao Forum For Asia (BFA), scheduled to be held in Beijing on 27-28 March, diplomatic sources said. The Boao Forum for Asia is a nonprofit platform that hosts high-level forums for leaders from government, business and academia in Asia and other continents to share their vision on the most pressing issues in this region and the world at large. Wishing not to be named, a high level source in the government Sunday evening told this correspondent that China has shown interest for a bilateral summit meeting with the Chief Adviser alongside attending the BFA conference during the visit to  Beijing  Foreign ministry officials said foreign adviser Md Touhid Hossain would leave for China in a bilateral meeting on Monday afternoon. He will hold a bilateral meeting with China Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing on Tuesday. The two will discuss how the relations would move forward. The health sector could get importance in cooperation between the two countries in the coming days. Discussions may be held on setting up a friendship hospital in Bangladesh with the help of China for the first time, ensuring low-cost medical services for Bangladeshi patients in several provinces, including Kunming, as well as on signing several memorandums of understanding (MoUs) on special projects for the care and rehabilitation of injured people in Dhaka. The chief adviser has recently been invited to attend the 25-nation BFA summit in Beijing from 25-28 March. China is interested in organising a discussion between the country’s top leaders, including President Xi Jinping, and Bangladesh’s top leader on the sidelines of the forum meeting. However, wishing not to be named, several foreign ministry officials think that there is uncertainty about the visit in March. State events are organised on 26 March due to Bangladesh’s Independence and National Day. Apart from this, it is also a matter of consideration, whether it is enough to organise a summit meeting just two months after the foreign adviser’s meeting. At the same time, diplomats believe that it is imperative to move cautiously instead of getting close to any country hurriedly due to the tilted policies of the previous government. A diplomatic source told this correspondent that the matter of sending a chartered plane from China to take Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus to Beijing was also mentioned. The source said the issue of the Chief Adviser’s visit to China may come up for discussion during the foreign affairs adviser’s visit to Beijing. Sources said that the issue of giving importance to the health sector in cooperation is expected to be discussed at the foreign minister-level meeting in Beijing Tuesday. Dhaka has proposed to Beijing to sign an MoU to set up a specialised medical and rehabilitation centre with financial and technical assistance from China, especially for the treatment and rehabilitation of those injured in the student uprising. Sources further said that Bangladesh is interested in signing an MoU quickly to construct the first friendship hospital, funded by China, in Purbachal. Bangladesh wants the hospital to be run by skilled physicians and professionals from China. Apart from this, Bangladesh wants China’s cooperation in identifying high-quality hospitals in Kunming and adjacent areas to ensure medical services for Bangladeshi patients. China’s Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen told Prothom Alo Sunday morning, “We agree in principle to establish a hospital in Bangladesh. We are now waiting for a detailed proposal from Bangladesh. We want to know what kind of hospital Bangladesh wants and where this hospital will be constructed.” “We will move forward following a process after receiving a proposal from Bangladesh. We are interested in modernising Bangladesh’s health sector,” he added. The MoU on sustainable management of river water, signed between the two countries in 2016, is scheduled to be renewed during the foreign adviser’s visit. The agreement signed between the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BPDB) and Power China is considered an outline MoU. Discussions are underway between the two countries on the Teesta project in continuation of this MoU. Speaking about the Teesta project, Yao Wen said, “We are interested in assisting Bangladesh in this project. Now it is Bangladesh that will have to decide how to implement it.” Diplomatic sources said the Bangladesh side at the meeting in Beijing will raise the construction of China’s mega dam in upstream of the Brahmaputra River. The country has taken the initiative to construct a dam worth about USD 100 billion in Tibet to generate about 60,000 MW electricity. This has created doubts about the availability of water for downstream countries. India has already expressed concerns over the construction of the dam. The Chinese ambassador met with adviser Touhid Hossain on Sunday morning. Later, speaking about the construction of the dam in Tibet, the ambassador said that the construction will not have any negative impact on the downstream countries. In the foreign minister level bilateral meeting, Bangladesh will put stress on investment, trade and project financing. In addition to reducing the interest rate from 2 per cent to a reasonable level, Dhaka will seek the cancellation of the 0.5 per cent loan commitment fee. The meeting will also discuss important projects, including the procurement of four ships as per the previous agreement, especially the projects for which financing is currently stalled. Dhaka will also seek China’s cooperation on the Rohingya issue. Bangladesh will also urge China to stand by the Rohingyas in the UN Security Council. At the same time, Bangladesh expects more investment from China. After 5 August, China has come forward with an investment of over USD 200 million. The country is also one of the major trading partners of Bangladesh. Dhaka will seek cooperation in free trade of goods and raw materials, including delayed payment. Bangladesh will also seek duty-free and quota-free facilities for Bangladeshi products in the Chinese market for an additional three years after graduating from a low-income country. Asked about the China visit, foreign adviser Md. Touhid Hossain told Prothom Alo, “There will be discussions on advancing cooperation between the two countries, keeping in mind the five-decade anniversary of the relations. Our priority will be economic and development cooperation.” * The report, originally published in the print and online editions of Prothom Alo, has been rewritten in English by Shameem Reza"
"CA leaves Dhaka for Davos to attend WEF","Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus left Dhaka for Davos, Switzerland, at early hours of Tuesday, on a four-day official visit to attend the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF). A flight of Emirates airline carrying Prof Yunus and his entourage left Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at 1:00 am (today), Chief Adviser’s Press Secretary Shafiul Alam told BSS. During his visit, the Chief Adviser is expected to hold bilateral talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Finland President Alexander Stubb, King Philippe of Belgium and Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra. The Chief Adviser will also hold meetings with Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, daughter of Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum; Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank; Sir Nick Clegg, President of Global Affairs at Meta; Dr Agnes Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International, and Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). A separate dialogue on Bangladesh will be held at the World Economic Forum where global business leaders and CEOs of various international organisations will join. The chief adviser is scheduled to return home on 25 January."
"A lost chapter in Bangladesh-Pakistan diplomacy","Bangladesh’s diplomacy is like an old-fashioned wall clock with a pendulum, swinging back and forth. For the past one and a half decades, it had tilted to one side, but now it may be time for a change in direction. In the recent past, relations with many countries were unusually ""good,"" while with others, they deteriorated. Now, efforts are underway to correct these ""abnormal"" chapters. At this time, efforts are also being made to revive the lost communication in the bilateral relationship between Bangladesh and Pakistan. There has been an increase in conversations between diplomats and politicians of both countries. 2024 marks the 50th anniversary of mutual recognition between Bangladesh and Pakistan. This moment is quite a celebratory one. At such a ""favorable moment,"" as efforts are being made to rebuild the relationship, a natural question arises: will the old sensitive issue of Bangladesh's outstanding dues with Pakistan be settled? This is a fundamental unresolved issue in their relationship. European countries have been functioning together in a union for 31 years. Unfortunately, the countries of South Asia have had a different experience. They initially separated into several entities and have not been able to form a union like the EU, nor have they managed to maintain even normal bilateral relations in many cases. Even a small conflict leads to the imposition of stricter visa policies on each other’s citizens. Due to such ""teenage"" mentality, expected commercial and cultural relations have not progressed. The Bangladesh-Pakistan relationship has suffered from similar misfortune. Pakistan’s export business with Bangladesh is less than $100 million, and only one-five-hundredth of Bangladesh’s total exports goes to Pakistan. Though Pakistan is somewhat ahead in this regard, high tariffs from Bangladesh have made it difficult for Pakistani goods to enter the country. Over the years, the flow of goods from Pakistan has been closely monitored as a political decision. For a long time, there have been no direct flights from Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) to Dhaka. Such a situation clearly needs to change. Together, both countries represent a market of over 400 million people. Normal diplomatic relations could open up significant opportunities for both nations. Pakistan could become a good market for Bangladesh's products, ranging from raw jute to pharmaceuticals. Recently, business chambers from both countries have formed a new council to increase trade. However, it is difficult for businessmen alone to smoothen interstate relations; only politicians can do that. To move forward, Bangladesh and Pakistan must address their old debts and unresolved issues. A significant obstacle in the past was the issue of Urdu-speaking people stranded in Bangladesh. Since Bangladesh granted them voting rights, Pakistan is now somewhat freed from this responsibility. The government of Dhaka has shown considerable generosity on this matter, and today’s Urdu-speaking generation is less inclined to move to Pakistan. Another unresolved issue concerns the division of post-independence resources. Although this issue hasn’t been discussed for a long time, it will need resolution to move the relationship forward. From Bangladesh’s perspective, the people have a legitimate claim to these resources, and no policymaker can ignore this demand. Pakistan and Bangladesh were united for 24 years. After their separation, the division of economic responsibilities naturally arose. These include sharing foreign assets, the foreign currency held in Bangladesh before the war, the surplus generated from exports and imports during the period of East Pakistan, and the receipt and repayment of foreign debts. There is also the matter of compensations for the war victims. However, due to the political emotions and tensions following 1971, this crucial task was not carried out dispassionately and remains unresolved. Although 54 years have passed, it is a matter that the leaders of both countries must resolve in one way or another. There are many precedents in international law regarding the division of state legacy after partition, the birth of new states, or the unification of two regions. Bangladesh and Pakistan can take guidance from these conventions to reach a satisfactory resolution on this disputed issue. In December, during the D-8 summit in Egypt, Bangladesh's interim government’s chief advisor, professor Muhammad Yunus, met with Pakistan’s prime minister Shahbaz Sharif. He appropriately mentioned that “old issues keep resurfacing, and to move forward, the unresolved matters must be settled, especially for the sake of future generations.” They had met earlier during the UN General Assembly as well. During Nawaz Sharif’s tenure in the past, Pakistan showed the most positive attitude toward bilateral issues. In this light, it can be said that now is a good moment for both countries to move forward in their relations. This is also an opportunity. Since independence, many Bangladeshi politicians and intellectuals have called for the settlement of old debts. During the war, Pakistan had reserves of about $4.25 billion, part of which many have claimed should be Bangladesh's share. In 1972, then prime minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman raised claims on this issue. During Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s visit in 1974, formal discussions on these debts took place, with Bangladesh presenting a claim for $4 billion.Later, Bhutto suggested that Bangladesh should also share the foreign debts from before 1971. Even though this was a negative approach, it acknowledged the rationale behind the division of assets, and Bangladesh agreed to take on a part of undivided Pakistan’s foreign debt, amounting to around $360 million. Under pressure from creditors, Bangladesh agreed to this decision. Bangladesh was positive from the beginning about advancing relations with Pakistan. However, Bangladesh’s acceptance of foreign debt from undivided Pakistan was related to the financial division at that time, and a resolution would need to come in a package. Although discussions on debts were halted after 1975, in 1978, Shamsul Haq, the foreign minister of Ziaur Rahman’s government, also raised the matter. While the Pakistani government initially remained silent on this issue, later Pakistan’s businessmen began raising concerns about compensating for their abandoned businesses in Bangladesh. This added complexity to the issue of state legacy. However, there are many elements worth listening to in the views of Pakistan’s industrialists and businessmen. The Bangladeshi government later took some corrective actions in response. But the Pakistani government has always been unwilling and unclear in addressing the state legacy of debts, and at times has used the issue of assets abandoned during the war to deflect attention from the matter. Such conflicting claims are an obstacle to healthy bilateral relations. What is needed is a solution where both sides can make concessions and receive something in return. Expectations are high that Pakistan’s foreign minister’s upcoming visit to Bangladesh will lead to positive progress on this matter. It is true that after the war, many industrial assets of West Pakistan were nationalised in Bangladesh. The Karachi Stock Exchange later made a record of these industries. For such assets, there is a need for extensive research to determine whether the post-war government in Bangladesh managed these properties correctly, how they were distributed, and where these assets are now. For many, this may seem like opening a Pandora’s Box, but avoiding the responsibilities of history is truly difficult. What could have started in 1972, is still an issue that cannot be avoided in 2025. At least, if relations with Pakistan are to progress, these matters will inevitably come to the fore. Even if governments try to avoid them, questions may be raised by non-governmental entities, and if avoided entirely, they could emerge in international forums. In the past, the return of Urdu-speaking people and the issue of war crimes overshadowed Bangladesh-Pakistan bilateral talks. Now that Bangladesh is handling the issue of Urdu speakers on its own terms, Pakistan may come up with positive proposals regarding the settlement of debts. Even if both countries feel embarrassed to discuss these matters directly, they could seek technical assistance from the UN or the OIC. Such initiatives would speed up potential commercial, diplomatic, and geopolitical cooperation. However, current efforts to normalize relations should not be held back by the division of debts. Bangladesh has already taken steps to import 50,000 metric tons of rice from Pakistan, among other goods, signaling an expansion of bilateral ties. Nevertheless, any normal relationship requires a transparent understanding of past wrongs. The future’s sustainability depends on past justice. In particular, the international assistance sent to East Pakistan during the November 1970 cyclone, which was not distributed due to the outbreak of war four months later (amounting to nearly $200 million), could serve as an immediate and inspiring precedent for Pakistan. In recent history, relations couldn't be continued even after elevating bilateral relations with India to great heights due to the unresolved Teesta water-sharing issue. Unresolved economic issues from before 1971 will inevitably resurface in the Bangladesh-Pakistan relationship. People might even wonder: if water-sharing can become an international issue, why not economic debts? **Altaf Parvez is a researcher on history **This column appeared in the print and online edition of Prothom Alo and has been rewritten for the English edition by Rabiul Islam"
"Medical admission postponed for candidates passed under quota, docs to be scrutinised","The documents of children of freedom fighters and underprivileged communities who passed the MBBS admission test under quota facilities for the 2024-25 education session will be scrutinised. If any of their information are found to be incorrect, their primary selection will be cancelled, the Directorate General of Medical Education (DGME) said on Monday. The admission procedure for the 193 students passed under the quota facilities will remain postponed until the completion of this scrutiny. However, the activities will continue for all other candidates. As per the provisions, there is a 5 per cent quota for the children of freedom fighters, martyred freedom fighters and Birangonas (war heroines). Besides, there is a 5 per cent reservation for the underprivileged communities. The MBBS admission test results were published on Sunday. But the students of several medical colleges, including the Dhaka Medical College, and university students have been staging demonstrations for the last two days, demanding republishing the results, scrapping the MBBS admission test results published on Sunday, and to do away with the quota system in the medical admission test. They submitted a memo for Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus around 3:00 pm today, Monday. They demanded the medical admission test results to be cancelled by 8:00 pm today and republish it. In this context, a notification of DGME today said their policy states that the documents of candidates passed under the quota facilities for the freedom fighters, martyred freedom fighters, war heroines and underprivileged communities will be scrutinised by the by the central admission committee and the admission process, subject to permission, will have to be completed. The candidates passed under the quota facilities for the underprivileged communities have been asked to remain present at the DGME with necessary documents on 23 and 26 January. Besides, the candidates passed under the quota facilities for the freedom fighters, martyred freedom fighters, and war heroines have been asked to show their documents at the DGME on 27, 28 and 29 January. DGME’s additional director general (medical education) Professor Rubina Yasmin told Prothom Alo the policy states about a 5 per cent quota for the children of freedom fighters, martyred freedom fighters, and war heroines. There will be none under this quota if the government takes a decision that this quota will no longer be in place. She further said, if the government decides to retain the quota, then the children of freedom fighters, martyred freedom fighters, and war heroines with valid documents will be selected. The remaining seats will be filled from the merit list."
"Trump pardons 1,500 defendants of 6 Jan, exits climate pact, doubles down on fossil fuel","Donald Trump pardoned about 1,500 of his supporters who attacked the US Capitol four years ago as he moved swiftly to impose his will on the US government just hours after reclaiming the presidency on Monday. After a day of ceremony, Trump signed a series of executive actions to curb immigration and roll back environmental regulations and racial and gender diversity initiatives. He did not take immediate action to raise tariffs, a key campaign promise, but said he could impose 25% duties on Canada and Mexico on 1 February. His decision to pardon supporters who attacked the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, is sure to enrage police, lawmakers and others whose lives were put at risk during an unprecedented episode in modern US history. Roughly 140 police officers were assaulted during the attack, with some sprayed with chemical irritants and others struck with pipes, poles and other weapons. Four people died during the chaos, including a Trump supporter who was shot dead by police. Among those covered by the order were leaders of the far-right Oath Keepers and Proud Boys militant groups, who were serving long prison sentences. Earlier in the day, Trump, 78, took the oath of office in the Capitol Rotunda, where a mob of his supporters had rampaged on Jan. 6 in an unsuccessful attempt to reverse his 2020 loss to Joe Biden. At the ceremony, Trump portrayed himself as a savior chosen by God to rescue a faltering nation. His inauguration amounts to a triumphant return for a political disruptor who survived two assassination attempts and won election despite a criminal conviction and a prosecution stemming from his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. “I was saved by God to make America great again,” he said. Trump is the first president in more than a century to win a second term after losing the White House and the first felon to occupy the White House. The oldest president ever to be sworn in, he is backed by Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress. Trump moved quickly to clamp down on illegal immigration, a signature issue since he first entered politics in 2015. Shortly after he took the oath of office, US border authorities shut down a program that allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to enter the US legally by scheduling an appointment through a smartphone. Existing appointments were canceled. At the White House, Trump signed an order that declared a national emergency at the US-Mexico border, which would unlock funding and allow him to dispatch troops there. He signed an order that would end a policy that confers citizenship to those born in the United States, which is certain to trigger a lengthy court fight. Another executive order designated Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organisations. “We’re getting rid of all the cancer ... caused by the Biden administration,” Trump said as he signed a stack of executive orders in the Oval Office. Other orders revoked Biden administration policies governing artificial intelligence and electric vehicles. He also imposed a freeze on federal hiring and ordered government workers to return to the office, rather than working from home. He also signed paperwork to create a “Department of Government Efficiency,” an outside advisory board headed by billionaire Elon Musk that aims to cut large swaths of government spending. In the State Department, more than a dozen nonpartisan senior diplomats were asked to resign as part of a broader plan to replace nonpartisan civil servants with loyalists. He also said he would issue orders to scrap federal diversity programs and require the government to recognise only genders assigned at birth. While Trump sought to portray himself as a peacemaker and unifier during his half-hour speech, his tone was often sharply partisan. He repeated false claims from his campaign that other countries were emptying their prisons into America and voiced familiar grievances over his criminal prosecutions. With Biden seated nearby, Trump issued a stinging indictment of his predecessor’s policies from immigration to foreign affairs. “We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders, but refuses to defend American borders, or more importantly, its own people,” Trump said. Numerous tech executives who have sought to curry favor with the incoming administration - including the three richest men in the world, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg - had prominent seats on stage, next to cabinet nominees and members of Trump’s family. Trump said he would send astronauts to Mars, prompting Musk - who has long talked about colonizing the planet - to raise his fists. Trump vowed to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America and repeated his intention to take back control of the Panama Canal, one of several foreign policy pronouncements that have caused consternation among US allies. Trump took the oath of office to “preserve, protect and defend” the US Constitution at 12:01 p.m. ET (1701 GMT), administered by Chief Justice John Roberts. His vice president, JD Vance, was sworn in just before him. Outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump in November, was seated next to Biden in a section with former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016, sat with her husband Bill. Obama’s wife, Michelle, chose not to attend. The ceremony was moved indoors due to the extreme cold gripping much of the country. Trump skipped Biden’s inauguration and has continued to claim falsely that the 2020 election he lost to Biden was rigged. Biden, in one of his last official acts, pardoned several people whom Trump has threatened with retaliation, including General Mark Milley, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who Trump has suggested should be executed for holding back-channel talks with China. Milley’s portrait was removed from the Pentagon shortly after Trump’s inauguration. He also pardoned five family members minutes before leaving office, citing fears that Trump would target them."

"US renews pledge to support Bangladesh's interim govt","The new Charge d'affaires of the US embassy in Dhaka Tracey Ann Jacobson Monday reiterated the support of her country for the Interim Government of Bangladesh on various issues, including development and counter-terrorism. ""We are prepared as a nation to support your government on a variety of issues,"" Jacobson told Chief Adviser professor Muhammad Yunus as she called on him at the State Guest House Jamuna in Dhaka. The Chief Adviser spoke about the ongoing reform initiatives in Bangladesh, the government's efforts to build a political consensus on the July proclamation and the plan for the next general election. Regarding the July proclamation, Dr Yunus said he was expecting the political parties to reach a consensus by early February. ""So far I have not heard any dissenting voices,"" he said, calling the political exercise to build the consensus on the issue a ""tough"" one and added that the theme of the proposed proclamation is ""unity."" The Chief Adviser said the government will only play the role of a facilitator. ""My job is building a consensus. I am not pushing any idea,"" he said. He said once the political parties agreed to the reform proposals, the government would request them to sign it to create a July Charter. ""We don't know whether the contents will contain many items or a few items,"" he told the US envoy. ""It's a tough job given the varieties of opinion we have. But the process has started. Once signed, our politics will be based on the July Charter,"" he added. The US Charge d'affaires raised concerns over the arrest of some journalists and reports of some violence against religious minorities. The Chief Adviser said his government is committed to ensuring justice for everyone in the country. During the hour-long meeting, they also discussed Dhaka's ties with its neighbours, progress on resolving the Rohingya crisis, and the security situation in Myanmar. The Chief Adviser said Bangladesh values its relationship with all neighbours. ""That's how the idea of SAARC came about, and we are the initiator of it,"" he said, highlighting his recent moves to revive SAARC and transform it into a platform like the European Union. He thanked the US for providing humanitarian assistance to Rohingya refugees and sought the country's support for the repatriation of the Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh and creating a safe zone for the displaced people in Myanmar's Rakhine State. The Chief Adviser mentioned that Bangladesh is a top importer of US cotton and urged the country to import more apparel and textiles, which would mean a greater import of US cotton. Lamiya Morshed, senior secretary to SDG affairs, was also present on the occasion."
"Police, RAB, Ansar to get new uniforms","The interim government has decided to change the uniforms of Bangladesh Police, Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and Bangladesh Ansar. Home Adviser Lieutenant General (retired) Md Jahangir Alam Chowdhury disclosed this at a press conference after a meeting of the advisory council committee on law and order at the Secretariat on Monday. Social Welfare Adviser Sharmeen Murshid and Special Assistant to Chief Adviser Khuda Baksh Chowdhury were also present at the event. A demand for reform to police rose after the fall of the Awami League government through the student-people uprising on 5 August. Demand for a change to police uniform also came to limelight. Replying to query on the reasons to change the uniforms of police, RAB and Ansar, the home adviser said it is necessary to change everyone’s mind-set and that is why uniforms of police, RAB, Ansar are going to be changed. It was revealed at the press conference that iron will the colour of police uniforms, olive for RAB and golden wheat for Ansar uniforms. Replying to query, the home adviser said the uniforms will be changed gradually. Police training will have to be changed to make the agency pro-people."
"What we know about Trump’s planned executive orders after swearing-in","Donald Trump plans to issue a flurry of executive orders and directives after he is sworn in as US president on Monday to put his stamp on his new administration on matters ranging from energy to immigration. Two sources familiar with the planning said more than 100 such orders and directives could be released starting on Day One in what is known internally as a ""shock and awe"" effort. Here is what we know about the executive orders so far: Trump plans to take a flurry of executive actions aimed at cracking down on legal and illegal immigration and ramping up deportations after he enters the White House on Monday, an incoming Trump administration official said. Trump intends to declare illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border a national emergency to support the construction of a border wall and send additional troops to the border, the official said. Trump will issue a sweeping proclamation that aims to block access to all asylum at the Mexico border, the official said. He will also issue an order intended to end birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children whose parents lack legal immigration status, the official said. Citing the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the official said in a briefing: ""The federal government will not recognize automatic birthright citizenship for children of illegal aliens born in the United States. We are also going to enhance vetting and screening of illegal aliens."" The U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment provides for granting citizenship to ""all persons born or naturalized in the United States."" Any move by Trump to end birthright citizenship would face a legal challenge. One of Trump's orders on Monday will declare a national energy emergency aimed at ""unleashing affordable and reliable American energy,"" an official with the incoming White House said. Trump, who vowed during his campaign to ""drill, baby, drill,"" will also sign an executive order focused on Alaska, the official said, adding that the state was critical to U.S. national security and could allow exports of LNG to other parts of the United States and allies. Sources familiar with the plans of members of Trump's transition team have said that Trump is considering executive orders to target everything from electric vehicles to withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, an action he took in his first administration. Members of his transition team are recommending sweeping changes to cut off support for electric vehicles and charging stations and to strengthen measures blocking the import of cars, components and battery materials from China, according to a document seen by Reuters. The transition team also recommends imposing tariffs on all battery materials globally, a bid to boost U.S. production, and then negotiating individual exemptions with allies, the document shows. Trump's executive orders will also likely seek to roll back Biden's climate regulations on power plants, end his pause on liquefied natural gas exports, and revoke waivers allowing California and other states to have tighter pollution rules. Trump will issue a broad trade memo on Monday that stops short of imposing new tariffs on his first day in office, but rather directs federal agencies to evaluate U.S. trade relationships with China, Canada and Mexico, an incoming Trump administration official said. The Republican incoming president has pledged tariffs of 10% on global imports, 60 per cent on Chinese goods and a 25 per cent import surcharge on Canadian and Mexican products, duties that may upend trade flows, raise costs and draw retaliation. The official, confirming a Wall Street Journal report, said Trump will direct agencies to investigate and remedy persistent trade deficits and address unfair trade and currency policies by other nations. The memo will single out China, Canada and Mexico for scrutiny but will not announce new tariffs, the official said. It will direct agencies to assess Beijing's compliance with its 2020 trade deal with the U.S., as well as the status of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, the official said. Trump believes tariffs would help boost economic growth in the United States, although opponents warn that the costs would likely be passed along to consumers. Trump will issue an executive order proclaiming that the U.S. federal government will only recognize two sexes, male and female, an incoming White House official said on Monday. Trump has vowed to sign an executive order ending transgender rights in the U.S. military and inside U.S. schools. As for transgender athletes, he told a rally on Sunday that he would act on his first day to stop the participation of trans athletes in women's sports. Trump will also issue an order ending ""radical and wasteful"" diversity, equity and inclusion programs inside the federal government, an incoming White House official said on Monday. During his first term, Trump signed an executive order to curtail efforts to address racial disparities in the workplace, through programs including diversity training inside companies. Biden reversed that executive order on his first day in office in January 2021, and Trump is likely to reinstate his original order early in his second term, and perhaps on his first day in office. Trump has also criticized ""diversity, equity and inclusion"" policies inside universities. Trump has also said he will take action immediately on taking office to issue pardons for some of the hundreds of people convicted or charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters. Trump said in a campaign video in 2023 that on his first day in office he would revoke the Biden administration's policies that provide information and resources to those seeking medical care so they can align their bodies with the gender they identify with. That care can include hormone therapy and surgery. Trump plans to classify drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations in an early executive order, Punchbowl News reported on Sunday, fulfilling a promise he made on the campaign trail to crack down on the sources of the lethal opioid fentanyl. Trump has railed against work-from-home arrangements for tens of thousands of federal employees, which were greatly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and he has vowed to end them. In December, Trump said if federal workers refuse to return to the office, “they’re going to be dismissed.” By forcing government workers back into the office Trump and his allies hope it could trigger large-scale resignations, which would assist in their goal of reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy."
"Dipu Moni writes on a tissue for 5 minutes in court","It was 9:05am this morning (Monday). A large blue prison van drove up to the gates of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrates (CMM) court, whistles blowing loudly. Former education minister Dipu Moni emerged from the van. Women police escorted her into the court custody room. Former member of parliament Haji Salim and others had already been brought earlier in the morning. Around 30 minutes after Dipu Moni arrived, Haji Salim was brought out by police. He was wearing a loose white panjabi. Haji Salim smiled broadly at the press, while the police held him by the arms on either side. Behind Haji Salim emerged former information and communication technology state minister Zunaid Ahmed Palak. After that, one after the other former law minister Anisul Huq, adviser to the former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, Salman F Rahman, Bangladesh Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon, Jatiya Samajtanktrik Dal (JASAD) president and former minister Hasanul Haque Inu and other were brought to the court room on the third floor of the CMM court. The lawyers of the accused were waiting there from beforehand. The judge came towards the court room at 9:40 am. A glum Haji Salim was placed in the dock and he started shouting. At one point the police asked that he be shown arrested in a murder case at the capital’s Jatrabari police station. Haji Salim’s legal counsel Pran Nath Roy appealed to the court to grant his client bail. He said his client could not speak and was unwell. He was arrested and put in jail for a long time. He had been at the Keraniganj central jail and received first division facilities as a member of parliament. However, he had recently been transferred to the Kashimpur jail. Lawyer Pran Nath Roy went on to tell the court that his client was not receiving any division facilities at the Kashimpur prison. The prison authorities did not understand Haji Salim’s words. He was facing a lot of problems there, The lawyer said his client would be much benefitted if the court granted him division. Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge Court public prosecutor (PP) Omar Faruqui opposed the bail appeal. After hearing both sides, the court rejected the bail appeal. The court ordered to show him as arrested and send him to jail. It was 10:00 am and in the crowded court room the hearing was on for the remand petition in two cases against Anisul Huq, Salman F Rahman and others. Dipu Moni was standing in the dock at the time. In front of her was former member of parliament ABM Fazle Karim Chowdhury. Standing to her left was Hasanul Haque Inu. At one point, Dipu Moni began writing with a pen in her right hand on a tissue in her left hand. Dipu Moni continued writing her “letter” for almost five minutes and then handed it over to a person in lawyer's garb standing in front of the dock. He kept the tissue folded in his left hand and indicated to Dipu that's he's take a picture of it. After handing over the letter, Dipu Moni started talking to Zunaid Ahmed. Dipu Moni was also seen smilingly talking to Salman F Rahman. Public prosecutor Omar Faruq Faruqui told Prothom Alo that he was taking part in the hearing and the dock was at a distance from there. There were many lawyers in the court and he had not spotted the matter of Dipu Moni writing a letter. If he had seen it, he would certainly have brought the matter to the court’s attention. After all, an accused is in custody of the court and cannot speak to anyone other than his or her lawyer. Speaking to Prothom Alo, Dipu Moni’s lawyer Gazi Faisal Islam told Prothom Alo that he had not seen his client write any such letter as the court was crowded and he had been in the front of the court, busy with the hearing. The court ordered Dipu Moni to be shown arrested in two murder cases at the Jatrabari police station and sent to jail. It was seen in court that when Anisul Huq was brought into the court room, he held his two hands in front. He stood gloomily in the dock. He only spoke for some time with his lawyer. After that he stood silent in the dock. Salman F Rahman was by his side but he did not talk to him. Former IGPs Shahidul Huq and Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun stood close by Anisul Huq. They spoke to each other for 5-10 minutes. Rashed Khan Menon was on one side of the dock and standing at a distance from him was Hasanul Haque Inu. They did not speak to each other. They spoke to their lawyers. After the hearing, the court granted permission to take Anisul Huq, Salman F Rahman, Hasanul Haque Inu, Rashed Khan Menon and Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun on remand for a varying number of days. Also, Zunaid Ahmed, Fazle Karim Chowdhury and Shahidul Huq were shown arrested in various cases."
"Giasuddin Al Mamun acquitted in arms case","The High Court on Monday acquitted Giasuddin Al Mamun, a businessman and close friend of BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, in an arms case. The HC bench of Justice Mustafa Zaman Islam and Justice Nasreen Akter passed the order after hearing a petition. Senior Barrister Syed Ahmed stood for Mamun. Mamun was arrested on January 30 in 2007 and was released from prison on August 6, 2024. Twenty cases were filed against Mamun on charges of his alleged involvement in corruption, extortion, money laundering and tax evasion. On 26 March 2007, a case was filed against him under the Arms Act. On 3 July 2007, the court sentenced him to 10 years imprisonment in the case. A petition was filed with the High Court challenging the verdict."
"Anisul, Salman, Inu, Menon and Mamun on remand again","The court has granted permission for former law minister Anisul Huq, Bangladesh Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon and Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal president Hasanul Haque Inu to be taken on 10 days remand in two murder cases filed at the Jatrabari police station. Permission was also granted by the court to take on remand for interrogation Salman F Rahman, former private investment and industries advisor to the prime minister, and Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun on remand, former Inspector General of Police (IGP). Following an appeal from the police, the Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) court issued the order today, Monday. Salman F Rahman and Anisul Huq were arrested on 13 August last year after the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government in face of the student-mass uprising. Rashed Khan Menon was arrested on 22 August and Hasanul Haque Inu on 26 August. Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun was arrested on 3 September.

In the meantime, the police has sought to take Anisul, Menon and Inu on 10 days' demand in the case pertaining to the murder of journalist Mehdi Hasan. Meanwhile, the lawyers of Anisul and others appealed for a rejection of the remand appeal. After hearing both sides, the court granted 10 days for Anisul, Menon and Inu to be taken on 10 days' remand, five days each for two separate murder cases.

Earlier today, Monday, they were taken from jail to the court. At 9:30pm they were placed in court."
"Biden pre-emptively pardons Trump foes","US President Joe Biden on Monday issued pre-emptive pardons to former Covid-19 advisor Anthony Fauci and retired general Mark Milley to shield them from “politically motivated prosecutions” under the Trump administration. In an extraordinary move in his last hours in the White House, Biden gave similar pardons to members, staff and witnesses of a US House committee probing the violent 6 January 2021 US Capitol attack by Donald Trump’s supporters. “These public servants have served our nation with honor and distinction and do not deserve to be the targets of unjustified and politically motivated prosecutions,” Biden said in a statement. “These are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing.” Trump, who will be sworn in on Monday, has repeatedly promised “retribution” against his political opponents and threatened some with criminal prosecution. Fauci became the face of the country’s fight against the Covid pandemic, but his straight-talking takes on the disease in Trump’s first term brought him into conflict with the Republican. It also turned the scientist into a hate figure for many on the right, including Elon Musk, Trump’s ally and the world’s richest man, who repeatedly called for Fauci to be prosecuted. Trump was enraged after Milley, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during Trump’s first term, told journalist Bob Woodward that Trump was “fascist to the core” and “the most dangerous person to this country.” Milley also revealed that he had secretly called his Chinese counterpart after the Capitol attack to reassure Beijing that the United States remained “stable” and had no intention to attack China. Trump subsequently wrote on his Truth Social network that “in times gone by, the punishment would have been DEATH!” for Milley. The members of the January 6 committee meanwhile include fierce Trump critic and former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, the daughter of former vice-president Dick Cheney. “Baseless and politically motivated investigations wreak havoc on the lives, safety, and financial security of targeted individuals and their families,” wrote Biden. The Democrat added that the pardons “should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense.” Trump has repeatedly complained of being the victim of “lawfare” under the Biden administration, after being criminally prosecuted for offenses including trying to subvert the 2020 election."
"Govt to buy sound grenades, teargas shells for BGB to use at border: Home Adviser ","The government has decided to procure sound grenades and teargas shells for the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) to use at the border. Home Adviser Lieutenant General (retired) Md Jahangir Alam Chowdhury disclosed this at a press conference after a meeting of the advisory council committee on law and order at the Secretariat on Monday. The home adviser said India’s Border Security Force (BSF) was seen using sound grenades and teargas shells along the Bangladesh-India border in Chapainawabganj recently, but BGB does not possess any sound grenades and teargas shells. They only possess lethal weapons. In this situation, a decision has been taken to procure sound grenades and teargas shells for the BGB and they will use those when the situation demands, he added. The home adviser further said the border, however, remains calm now. Referring to the stay of illegal immigrants in Bangladesh, adviser Jahangir Alam said many foreigners have been living in Bangladesh illegally as their visa expired. However, the number of illegal immigrants decreased to 33,638 from 49,226 and the government earned Tk 100 million from the application fees to legalise their stay, he added. Those who helped immigrants stay illegally in the country will face action, Jahangir Alam warned."
"Trump signs order to pull US from WHO, citing funding disparities","President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order directing the United States to withdraw from the World Health Organisation (WHO), a body he has repeatedly criticised over its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Speaking at the White House hours after his inauguration, Trump said the United States was paying far more to the UN body compared to China, adding: “World Health ripped us off.” The United States, the largest donor to the Geneva-based organization, provides substantial financial support that is vital to the WHO’s operations. Its withdrawal is expected to trigger a significant restructuring of the institution and could further disrupt global health initiatives. This marks the second time Trump has sought to sever ties with the WHO. During his first term, the United States issued a notice of intent to withdraw, accusing the organization of being overly influenced by China during the pandemic’s early stages. That move was later reversed under former president Joe Biden’s administration. In his new executive order, Trump directed agencies to “pause the future transfer of any United States Government funds, support, or resources to the WHO” and to “identify credible and transparent United States and international partners to assume necessary activities previously undertaken by the WHO.” The administration also announced plans to review and rescind Biden’s 2024 US Global Health Security Strategy, which was designed to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, “as soon as practicable.” The timing of the US withdrawal comes amid mounting fears over the pandemic potential of the current bird flu outbreak (H5N1), which has infected dozens and claimed one life in the United States. Meanwhile, WHO member states have been negotiating the world’s first treaty on pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response since late 2021 -- negotiations now set to proceed without US participation."
"Dhaka greets Trump marking his inauguration","Dhaka Monday extended greetings to Donald Trump who was set to be sworn-in for a second term as president of the United States of America (USA) within a few hours in Washington DC. “Honorable Chief Adviser (Muhammad Yunus) had sent a congratulatory message to Mr. Donald Trump upon his election as the President of the United States. In that message, the Chief Adviser expressed firm belief that both nations would work together to explore new avenues of cooperation,” read a message of Bangladesh foreign ministry that was shared with the media. The message read, “We reaffirm that belief and extend our best wishes to Mr. Donald Trump as he begins his new term.” In a ceremony moved indoors because of bitterly cold weather, Trump will take the oath of office in the Rotunda of the Capitol in Washington DC. “I am delighted to convey, on behalf of the government and the people of Bangladesh, my heartfelt felicitations to you on your victory in the US Presidential Election 2024,” Chief Adviser Professor Muhamamd Yunus said in a congratulatory message to Trump after his win in the US election in November last year. “Electing you as the US President for a second term reflects that your leadership and vision have resonated with the people of the United States of America. I am confident that under your stewardship, the United States will thrive and continue to inspire others around the world,” the message read. Dr Yunus said Bangladesh and the US share a long history of friendship and collaboration across numerous areas of mutual interest. The relationship continued to grow in depth and breadth during Trump’s previous term in the office, he said. The chief adviser said he firmly believes that the possibilities are endless as the two friendly nations work towards exploring newer avenues of partnership."
"Tech billionaires take center stage at Trump inauguration","Tech billionaires including Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were given prime positions at Donald Trump's inauguration Monday, in an unprecedented demonstration of their power and influence on US politics. Musk, Bezos and Zuckerberg are the world's three richest people, according to Forbes. Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who also attended, ranks seventh. US tech tycoons have spent the weeks since the election courting favor with Trump, marking a dramatic shift from Silicon Valley's more hostile response to his first term as president four years ago. Attendees also included Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. TikTok CEO Shou Chew sat in the back row of the stage, even as his platform's future remains uncertain. Trump later in the day ordered a 75-day pause on enforcing a law that would effectively ban TikTok in the United States. Despite highly limited seating after the ceremony was moved indoors due to bad weather, Meta CEO Zuckerberg attended with his wife Priscilla Chan, while Amazon executive chairman Bezos was accompanied by his fiancee, Lauren Sanchez. ""When the three wealthiest men in America sit behind Trump at his inauguration, everyone understands that the billionaire class now controls our government,"" left-wing US Senator Bernie Sanders said in a social media post. The tech titans' prominent positions on the inauguration stage was particularly notable for Zuckerberg, whom Trump had threatened with life imprisonment just months ago. The Meta chief recently made headlines by brashly aligning his company's policies with Trump's conservative worldview, notably by eliminating fact-checking in the United States and relaxing hate speech restrictions on Facebook and Instagram. Musk has shown the strongest support for Trump, spending USD 277 million to help him and other Republicans win November's election while transforming his X platform into an amplifier for pro-Trump voices. Bezos, like Zuckerberg and his peers, has visited Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida leading up to the inauguration, with favorable treatment, government contracts and reduced regulatory scrutiny for Amazon at stake. As owner of The Washington Post, Bezos sparked controversy by blocking the newspaper's planned endorsement of Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris for the 2024 presidential election, triggering newsroom protests and subscriber cancellations. Musk has been named a leader of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency to advise the White House on cuts to public spending and has spent much of the past two months at Mar-a-Lago.  While Musk's SpaceX is already a major government contractor, Amazon's AWS cloud computing division and Google also count the US government among their biggest clients. Google, Meta, Apple and Amazon are also fighting landmark antitrust lawsuits from the US government. ""These are very wealthy people who have basically paid for access, which is something that they would do for any upcoming administration even if we all recognize Trump is very transactional,"" said Andrew Selepak, a media professor at the University of Florida. ""They're making sure it's very clear that their faces, names, and especially their money, is here,"" he added."

"Fewer books sent to schools, education limping on","The boy was pacing the corridor of Ideal School and College in the capital’s Motijheel area. He’s a student of class-VII at this institution. On the 19th day of the academic calendar, he finally received the textbooks provided from the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) on Sunday. However, he received only three (Shoptoborna, Anondopath, and English) out of 13 books prescribed for his class. He said that he has the PDF versions of the books downloaded at home. Another student of class-IX from the English version of the school said he has not received even a single textbook yet. His teachers give lectures in the class taking help of printed copies of the downloaded PDF book. And, he studies from the website at home. A teacher of the school with administrative responsibilities said that they have received and distributed all the primary level textbooks of the Bangla version. At the secondary level, they have provided the students of class-VI with three textbooks, students of class-VIII and IX with two books while the students of tenth graders each received just four textbooks. However, no textbook of the primary or the secondary level for the English version has arrived yet. There are more than 7,000 students studying in the Bangla version at the Mothijheel branch of this school and over 3,000 students in the English version. This is the current state of free textbook distribution at the primary and the secondary levels in this renowned school of Dhaka. However, this institution is not alone; the picture is more or less the same everywhere. Visiting at least 25 schools in all eight divisions of the country, including Dhaka, on behalf of Prothom Alo this Sunday, it was found that in none of those schools did all the classes receive all the new books. Most of the students from class-I to III have received all the books while the fourth to tenth graders are yet to receive most of their books. These students, that too not all of them, have received the Bangla, English, and Mathematics textbooks mostly. In this circumstance, the lessons and studies are going on in a patchy manner. Classes are not being conducted properly and the presence of students is low as well. Some teachers are downloading the PDF versions from the website to teach from that. In some places students are learning from the previous year’s textbooks. Some teachers are teaching from their experience while some schools are teaching basics in the absence of textbooks. Many of the students are also downloading the PDF versions to study. The secondary and higher education division says that it would take till February for all the students to receive the books. However, observing the actual situation at hand it seems that by February it might be possible to distribute all the books of the primary level only. But it might take till March to reach all the books of the secondary level to the students, people involved in the printing business reckon. The new academic year started on 1 January.  According to NCTB sources around 401.5 million textbooks are being printed for about 40 million primary and secondary level students in the new academic year. Of them, more than 90 million textbooks are for the primary level. More than 60 million (6 crore) of those books have been certified in pre-delivery inspection till 18 January. That means more than 65 per cent of these textbooks have been delivered already. Meanwhile, the number of textbooks required on the secondary level (including Ibtedayi from Madrasah) is close to 301 million. As per NCTB sources, more than 62.5 million secondary level textbooks have been delivered up to 18 January while about 95.6 million textbooks have been printed in total. The curriculum has been changed and the textbooks have been revised this year owing to the change of political setting. That is why the printing of the textbooks was delayed. Then there was also delay in completing tasks like calling for tenders, giving approval and signing contracts. Now, printers are also speaking of some issues including shortage of paper and art cards, lack of sufficient binders, and difficulty in taking bank loans. This time, students are suffering delays in receiving books and it’s the fault of both the education division as well as the printers. Speaking about this, NCTB chairman professor AKM Reazul Hassan told Prothom Alo Sunday that they are continuing with their efforts to deliver the books faster. At the initiative of the education adviser and the senior secretary of the secondary and higher education division, they are trying to solve the issues mentioned by the printers. They expect to deliver all the books of the primary level and the ones of class-X within the current month. Meanwhile, the books of class-VI to IX would also be available to students by 15th to 20th of the next month, he added. This correspondent visited four schools in Dhaka city in person Sunday. One of those four schools was Provati Uchya Biddyaniketon in the Eskaton area. One of the teachers there revealed that all the books of class-I, II and III have arrived.  On the other hand they have received three out of six books of class-IV, four books of class-V, three books of class-VI and none of the books of class-VII. Also, only three of the books have arrived for the students of class-VIII, IX and X. They received these books in three installments. Assistant teacher of information and communication technology (ICT) at the school, Syed Abed Ali said that they have not received the ICT textbooks yet. He is conducting lessons from his experience with the help of the website. While visiting the English version of BIAM Laboratory School, it was found that the textbooks for students up to class-III arrived on Thursday while the books of class-IV and V are yet to be received. Students are taught up to class-VIII at the Ideal Government Primary School in Motijheel. All the textbooks have been distributed among students up to class-V at this school.

One of the teachers at the school told Prothom Alo that classes have been going on irregularly in the absence of books. Speaking to Prothom Alo, Chattogram district education officer Uttam Khisa said that the demand of the textbooks in the district stands at 17.4 million.

"China keen to take Chief Adviser to Beijing in March","Following the 5 August 2024 changeover due to the student-people uprising, China is keen to deepen the relations with Bangladesh. Beijing is interested in a summit meeting in continuation of bilateral meetings with the interim government. That is why China wants to take Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus to China in March this year, marking five decades of diplomatic relations between the two countries. China has already invited Dr Muhammad Yunus to attend the Boao Forum For Asia (BFA), scheduled to be held in Beijing on 27-28 March, diplomatic sources said. The Boao Forum for Asia is a nonprofit platform that hosts high-level forums for leaders from government, business and academia in Asia and other continents to share their vision on the most pressing issues in this region and the world at large. Wishing not to be named, a high level source in the government Sunday evening told this correspondent that China has shown interest for a bilateral summit meeting with the Chief Adviser alongside attending the BFA conference during the visit to  Beijing  Foreign ministry officials said foreign adviser Md Touhid Hossain would leave for China in a bilateral meeting on Monday afternoon. He will hold a bilateral meeting with China Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing on Tuesday. The two will discuss how the relations would move forward. The health sector could get importance in cooperation between the two countries in the coming days. Discussions may be held on setting up a friendship hospital in Bangladesh with the help of China for the first time, ensuring low-cost medical services for Bangladeshi patients in several provinces, including Kunming, as well as on signing several memorandums of understanding (MoUs) on special projects for the care and rehabilitation of injured people in Dhaka. The chief adviser has recently been invited to attend the 25-nation BFA summit in Beijing from 25-28 March. China is interested in organising a discussion between the country’s top leaders, including President Xi Jinping, and Bangladesh’s top leader on the sidelines of the forum meeting. However, wishing not to be named, several foreign ministry officials think that there is uncertainty about the visit in March. State events are organised on 26 March due to Bangladesh’s Independence and National Day. Apart from this, it is also a matter of consideration, whether it is enough to organise a summit meeting just two months after the foreign adviser’s meeting. At the same time, diplomats believe that it is imperative to move cautiously instead of getting close to any country hurriedly due to the tilted policies of the previous government. A diplomatic source told this correspondent that the matter of sending a chartered plane from China to take Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus to Beijing was also mentioned. The source said the issue of the Chief Adviser’s visit to China may come up for discussion during the foreign affairs adviser’s visit to Beijing. Sources said that the issue of giving importance to the health sector in cooperation is expected to be discussed at the foreign minister-level meeting in Beijing Tuesday. Dhaka has proposed to Beijing to sign an MoU to set up a specialised medical and rehabilitation centre with financial and technical assistance from China, especially for the treatment and rehabilitation of those injured in the student uprising. Sources further said that Bangladesh is interested in signing an MoU quickly to construct the first friendship hospital, funded by China, in Purbachal. Bangladesh wants the hospital to be run by skilled physicians and professionals from China. Apart from this, Bangladesh wants China’s cooperation in identifying high-quality hospitals in Kunming and adjacent areas to ensure medical services for Bangladeshi patients. China’s Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen told Prothom Alo Sunday morning, “We agree in principle to establish a hospital in Bangladesh. We are now waiting for a detailed proposal from Bangladesh. We want to know what kind of hospital Bangladesh wants and where this hospital will be constructed.” “We will move forward following a process after receiving a proposal from Bangladesh. We are interested in modernising Bangladesh’s health sector,” he added. The MoU on sustainable management of river water, signed between the two countries in 2016, is scheduled to be renewed during the foreign adviser’s visit. The agreement signed between the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BPDB) and Power China is considered an outline MoU. Discussions are underway between the two countries on the Teesta project in continuation of this MoU. Speaking about the Teesta project, Yao Wen said, “We are interested in assisting Bangladesh in this project. Now it is Bangladesh that will have to decide how to implement it.” Diplomatic sources said the Bangladesh side at the meeting in Beijing will raise the construction of China’s mega dam in upstream of the Brahmaputra River. The country has taken the initiative to construct a dam worth about USD 100 billion in Tibet to generate about 60,000 MW electricity. This has created doubts about the availability of water for downstream countries. India has already expressed concerns over the construction of the dam. The Chinese ambassador met with adviser Touhid Hossain on Sunday morning. Later, speaking about the construction of the dam in Tibet, the ambassador said that the construction will not have any negative impact on the downstream countries. In the foreign minister level bilateral meeting, Bangladesh will put stress on investment, trade and project financing. In addition to reducing the interest rate from 2 per cent to a reasonable level, Dhaka will seek the cancellation of the 0.5 per cent loan commitment fee. The meeting will also discuss important projects, including the procurement of four ships as per the previous agreement, especially the projects for which financing is currently stalled. Dhaka will also seek China’s cooperation on the Rohingya issue. Bangladesh will also urge China to stand by the Rohingyas in the UN Security Council. At the same time, Bangladesh expects more investment from China. After 5 August, China has come forward with an investment of over USD 200 million. The country is also one of the major trading partners of Bangladesh. Dhaka will seek cooperation in free trade of goods and raw materials, including delayed payment. Bangladesh will also seek duty-free and quota-free facilities for Bangladeshi products in the Chinese market for an additional three years after graduating from a low-income country. Asked about the China visit, foreign adviser Md. Touhid Hossain told Prothom Alo, “There will be discussions on advancing cooperation between the two countries, keeping in mind the five-decade anniversary of the relations. Our priority will be economic and development cooperation.” * The report, originally published in the print and online editions of Prothom Alo, has been rewritten in English by Shameem Reza"
"CA leaves Dhaka for Davos to attend WEF","Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus left Dhaka for Davos, Switzerland, at early hours of Tuesday, on a four-day official visit to attend the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF). A flight of Emirates airline carrying Prof Yunus and his entourage left Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at 1:00 am (today), Chief Adviser’s Press Secretary Shafiul Alam told BSS. During his visit, the Chief Adviser is expected to hold bilateral talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Finland President Alexander Stubb, King Philippe of Belgium and Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra.

The chief adviser is scheduled to return home on 25 January."
"Trump pardons 1,500 defendants of 6 Jan, exits climate pact, doubles down on fossil fuel","Donald Trump pardoned about 1,500 of his supporters who attacked the US Capitol four years ago as he moved swiftly to impose his will on the US government just hours after reclaiming the presidency on Monday. After a day of ceremony, Trump signed a series of executive actions to curb immigration and roll back environmental regulations and racial and gender diversity initiatives. He did not take immediate action to raise tariffs, a key campaign promise, but said he could impose 25% duties on Canada and Mexico on 1 February. His decision to pardon supporters who attacked the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, is sure to enrage police, lawmakers and others whose lives were put at risk during an unprecedented episode in modern US history. Roughly 140 police officers were assaulted during the attack, with some sprayed with chemical irritants and others struck with pipes, poles and other weapons. Four people died during the chaos, including a Trump supporter who was shot dead by police. Among those covered by the order were leaders of the far-right Oath Keepers and Proud Boys militant groups, who were serving long prison sentences. Earlier in the day, Trump, 78, took the oath of office in the Capitol Rotunda, where a mob of his supporters had rampaged on Jan. 6 in an unsuccessful attempt to reverse his 2020 loss to Joe Biden. At the ceremony, Trump portrayed himself as a savior chosen by God to rescue a faltering nation. His inauguration amounts to a triumphant return for a political disruptor who survived two assassination attempts and won election despite a criminal conviction and a prosecution stemming from his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. “I was saved by God to make America great again,” he said. Trump is the first president in more than a century to win a second term after losing the White House and the first felon to occupy the White House. The oldest president ever to be sworn in, he is backed by Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress. Trump moved quickly to clamp down on illegal immigration, a signature issue since he first entered politics in 2015. Shortly after he took the oath of office, US border authorities shut down a program that allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to enter the US legally by scheduling an appointment through a smartphone. Existing appointments were canceled. At the White House, Trump signed an order that declared a national emergency at the US-Mexico border, which would unlock funding and allow him to dispatch troops there. He signed an order that would end a policy that confers citizenship to those born in the United States, which is certain to trigger a lengthy court fight. Another executive order designated Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organisations. “We’re getting rid of all the cancer ... caused by the Biden administration,” Trump said as he signed a stack of executive orders in the Oval Office. Other orders revoked Biden administration policies governing artificial intelligence and electric vehicles. He also imposed a freeze on federal hiring and ordered government workers to return to the office, rather than working from home. He also signed paperwork to create a “Department of Government Efficiency,” an outside advisory board headed by billionaire Elon Musk that aims to cut large swaths of government spending. In the State Department, more than a dozen nonpartisan senior diplomats were asked to resign as part of a broader plan to replace nonpartisan civil servants with loyalists. He also said he would issue orders to scrap federal diversity programs and require the government to recognise only genders assigned at birth. While Trump sought to portray himself as a peacemaker and unifier during his half-hour speech, his tone was often sharply partisan. He repeated false claims from his campaign that other countries were emptying their prisons into America and voiced familiar grievances over his criminal prosecutions. With Biden seated nearby, Trump issued a stinging indictment of his predecessor’s policies from immigration to foreign affairs. “We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders, but refuses to defend American borders, or more importantly, its own people,” Trump said. Numerous tech executives who have sought to curry favor with the incoming administration - including the three richest men in the world, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg - had prominent seats on stage, next to cabinet nominees and members of Trump’s family. Trump said he would send astronauts to Mars, prompting Musk - who has long talked about colonizing the planet - to raise his fists. Trump vowed to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America and repeated his intention to take back control of the Panama Canal, one of several foreign policy pronouncements that have caused consternation among US allies. Trump took the oath of office to “preserve, protect and defend” the US Constitution at 12:01 p.m. ET (1701 GMT), administered by Chief Justice John Roberts. His vice president, JD Vance, was sworn in just before him. Outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump in November, was seated next to Biden in a section with former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016, sat with her husband Bill. Obama’s wife, Michelle, chose not to attend. The ceremony was moved indoors due to the extreme cold gripping much of the country. Trump skipped Biden’s inauguration and has continued to claim falsely that the 2020 election he lost to Biden was rigged. Biden, in one of his last official acts, pardoned several people whom Trump has threatened with retaliation, including General Mark Milley, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who Trump has suggested should be executed for holding back-channel talks with China. Milley’s portrait was removed from the Pentagon shortly after Trump’s inauguration. He also pardoned five family members minutes before leaving office, citing fears that Trump would target them."
"Ali Imam Majumdar given charge of land ministry","Food Adviser Ali Imam Majumdar has been given the additional charge of Land Ministry, The Cabinet Division issued an official notification in this regard on Monday. This move follows the passing of former Land Adviser AF Hassan Ariff who died of a heart attack on 20 December. The notification said that, in line with previous communications from the Cabinet Division dated 16 August, 27 August, and 10 November, the Chief Adviser of the Interim Government has now assigned Ali Imam Majumdar with the additional responsibility of the Ministry of Land."
"US renews pledge to support Bangladesh's interim govt","The new Charge d'affaires of the US embassy in Dhaka Tracey Ann Jacobson Monday reiterated the support of her country for the Interim Government of Bangladesh on various issues, including development and counter-terrorism. ""We are prepared as a nation to support your government on a variety of issues,"" Jacobson told Chief Adviser professor Muhammad Yunus as she called on him at the State Guest House Jamuna in Dhaka. The Chief Adviser spoke about the ongoing reform initiatives in Bangladesh, the government's efforts to build a political consensus on the July proclamation and the plan for the next general election. Regarding the July proclamation, Dr Yunus said he was expecting the political parties to reach a consensus by early February. ""So far I have not heard any dissenting voices,"" he said, calling the political exercise to build the consensus on the issue a ""tough"" one and added that the theme of the proposed proclamation is ""unity."" The Chief Adviser said the government will only play the role of a facilitator. ""My job is building a consensus. I am not pushing any idea,"" he said. He said once the political parties agreed to the reform proposals, the government would request them to sign it to create a July Charter. ""We don't know whether the contents will contain many items or a few items,"" he told the US envoy. ""It's a tough job given the varieties of opinion we have. But the process has started. Once signed, our politics will be based on the July Charter,"" he added. The US Charge d'affaires raised concerns over the arrest of some journalists and reports of some violence against religious minorities. The Chief Adviser said his government is committed to ensuring justice for everyone in the country. During the hour-long meeting, they also discussed Dhaka's ties with its neighbours, progress on resolving the Rohingya crisis, and the security situation in Myanmar. The Chief Adviser said Bangladesh values its relationship with all neighbours. ""That's how the idea of SAARC came about, and we are the initiator of it,"" he said, highlighting his recent moves to revive SAARC and transform it into a platform like the European Union. He thanked the US for providing humanitarian assistance to Rohingya refugees and sought the country's support for the repatriation of the Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh and creating a safe zone for the displaced people in Myanmar's Rakhine State. The Chief Adviser mentioned that Bangladesh is a top importer of US cotton and urged the country to import more apparel and textiles, which would mean a greater import of US cotton. Lamiya Morshed, senior secretary to SDG affairs, was also present on the occasion."
"Police, RAB, Ansar to get new uniforms","The interim government has decided to change the uniforms of Bangladesh Police, Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and Bangladesh Ansar. Home Adviser Lieutenant General (retired) Md Jahangir Alam Chowdhury disclosed this at a press conference after a meeting of the advisory council committee on law and order at the Secretariat on Monday. Social Welfare Adviser Sharmeen Murshid and Special Assistant to Chief Adviser Khuda Baksh Chowdhury were also present at the event. A demand for reform to police rose after the fall of the Awami League government through the student-people uprising on 5 August. Demand for a change to police uniform also came to limelight. Replying to query on the reasons to change the uniforms of police, RAB and Ansar, the home adviser said it is necessary to change everyone’s mind-set and that is why uniforms of police, RAB, Ansar are going to be changed. It was revealed at the press conference that iron will the colour of police uniforms, olive for RAB and golden wheat for Ansar uniforms. Replying to query, the home adviser said the uniforms will be changed gradually. Police training will have to be changed to make the agency pro-people."
"What we know about Trump’s planned executive orders after swearing-in","Donald Trump plans to issue a flurry of executive orders and directives after he is sworn in as US president on Monday to put his stamp on his new administration on matters ranging from energy to immigration. Two sources familiar with the planning said more than 100 such orders and directives could be released starting on Day One in what is known internally as a ""shock and awe"" effort. Here is what we know about the executive orders so far: Trump plans to take a flurry of executive actions aimed at cracking down on legal and illegal immigration and ramping up deportations after he enters the White House on Monday, an incoming Trump administration official said. Trump intends to declare illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border a national emergency to support the construction of a border wall and send additional troops to the border, the official said. Trump will issue a sweeping proclamation that aims to block access to all asylum at the Mexico border, the official said. He will also issue an order intended to end birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children whose parents lack legal immigration status, the official said. Citing the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the official said in a briefing: ""The federal government will not recognize automatic birthright citizenship for children of illegal aliens born in the United States. We are also going to enhance vetting and screening of illegal aliens."" The U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment provides for granting citizenship to ""all persons born or naturalized in the United States."" Any move by Trump to end birthright citizenship would face a legal challenge. One of Trump's orders on Monday will declare a national energy emergency aimed at ""unleashing affordable and reliable American energy,"" an official with the incoming White House said. Trump, who vowed during his campaign to ""drill, baby, drill,"" will also sign an executive order focused on Alaska, the official said, adding that the state was critical to U.S. national security and could allow exports of LNG to other parts of the United States and allies. Sources familiar with the plans of members of Trump's transition team have said that Trump is considering executive orders to target everything from electric vehicles to withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, an action he took in his first administration. Members of his transition team are recommending sweeping changes to cut off support for electric vehicles and charging stations and to strengthen measures blocking the import of cars, components and battery materials from China, according to a document seen by Reuters. The transition team also recommends imposing tariffs on all battery materials globally, a bid to boost U.S. production, and then negotiating individual exemptions with allies, the document shows. Trump's executive orders will also likely seek to roll back Biden's climate regulations on power plants, end his pause on liquefied natural gas exports, and revoke waivers allowing California and other states to have tighter pollution rules. Trump will issue a broad trade memo on Monday that stops short of imposing new tariffs on his first day in office, but rather directs federal agencies to evaluate U.S. trade relationships with China, Canada and Mexico, an incoming Trump administration official said. The Republican incoming president has pledged tariffs of 10% on global imports, 60 per cent on Chinese goods and a 25 per cent import surcharge on Canadian and Mexican products, duties that may upend trade flows, raise costs and draw retaliation. The official, confirming a Wall Street Journal report, said Trump will direct agencies to investigate and remedy persistent trade deficits and address unfair trade and currency policies by other nations. The memo will single out China, Canada and Mexico for scrutiny but will not announce new tariffs, the official said. It will direct agencies to assess Beijing's compliance with its 2020 trade deal with the U.S., as well as the status of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, the official said. Trump believes tariffs would help boost economic growth in the United States, although opponents warn that the costs would likely be passed along to consumers. Trump will issue an executive order proclaiming that the U.S. federal government will only recognize two sexes, male and female, an incoming White House official said on Monday. Trump has vowed to sign an executive order ending transgender rights in the U.S. military and inside U.S. schools. As for transgender athletes, he told a rally on Sunday that he would act on his first day to stop the participation of trans athletes in women's sports. Trump will also issue an order ending ""radical and wasteful"" diversity, equity and inclusion programs inside the federal government, an incoming White House official said on Monday. During his first term, Trump signed an executive order to curtail efforts to address racial disparities in the workplace, through programs including diversity training inside companies. Biden reversed that executive order on his first day in office in January 2021, and Trump is likely to reinstate his original order early in his second term, and perhaps on his first day in office. Trump has also criticized ""diversity, equity and inclusion"" policies inside universities. Trump has also said he will take action immediately on taking office to issue pardons for some of the hundreds of people convicted or charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters. Trump said in a campaign video in 2023 that on his first day in office he would revoke the Biden administration's policies that provide information and resources to those seeking medical care so they can align their bodies with the gender they identify with. That care can include hormone therapy and surgery. Trump plans to classify drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations in an early executive order, Punchbowl News reported on Sunday, fulfilling a promise he made on the campaign trail to crack down on the sources of the lethal opioid fentanyl. Trump has railed against work-from-home arrangements for tens of thousands of federal employees, which were greatly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and he has vowed to end them. In December, Trump said if federal workers refuse to return to the office, “they’re going to be dismissed.” By forcing government workers back into the office Trump and his allies hope it could trigger large-scale resignations, which would assist in their goal of reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy."
"Dipu Moni writes on a tissue for 5 minutes in court","It was 9:05am this morning (Monday). A large blue prison van drove up to the gates of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrates (CMM) court, whistles blowing loudly. Former education minister Dipu Moni emerged from the van. Women police escorted her into the court custody room. Former member of parliament Haji Salim and others had already been brought earlier in the morning. Around 30 minutes after Dipu Moni arrived, Haji Salim was brought out by police. He was wearing a loose white panjabi. Haji Salim smiled broadly at the press, while the police held him by the arms on either side. Behind Haji Salim emerged former information and communication technology state minister Zunaid Ahmed Palak. After that, one after the other former law minister Anisul Huq, adviser to the former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, Salman F Rahman, Bangladesh Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon, Jatiya Samajtanktrik Dal (JASAD) president and former minister Hasanul Haque Inu and other were brought to the court room on the third floor of the CMM court. The lawyers of the accused were waiting there from beforehand. The judge came towards the court room at 9:40 am. A glum Haji Salim was placed in the dock and he started shouting. At one point the police asked that he be shown arrested in a murder case at the capital’s Jatrabari police station. Haji Salim’s legal counsel Pran Nath Roy appealed to the court to grant his client bail. He said his client could not speak and was unwell. He was arrested and put in jail for a long time. He had been at the Keraniganj central jail and received first division facilities as a member of parliament. However, he had recently been transferred to the Kashimpur jail. Lawyer Pran Nath Roy went on to tell the court that his client was not receiving any division facilities at the Kashimpur prison. The prison authorities did not understand Haji Salim’s words. He was facing a lot of problems there, The lawyer said his client would be much benefitted if the court granted him division. Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge Court public prosecutor (PP) Omar Faruqui opposed the bail appeal. After hearing both sides, the court rejected the bail appeal. The court ordered to show him as arrested and send him to jail. It was 10:00 am and in the crowded court room the hearing was on for the remand petition in two cases against Anisul Huq, Salman F Rahman and others. Dipu Moni was standing in the dock at the time. In front of her was former member of parliament ABM Fazle Karim Chowdhury. Standing to her left was Hasanul Haque Inu. At one point, Dipu Moni began writing with a pen in her right hand on a tissue in her left hand. Dipu Moni continued writing her “letter” for almost five minutes and then handed it over to a person in lawyer's garb standing in front of the dock. He kept the tissue folded in his left hand and indicated to Dipu that's he's take a picture of it. After handing over the letter, Dipu Moni started talking to Zunaid Ahmed. Dipu Moni was also seen smilingly talking to Salman F Rahman. Public prosecutor Omar Faruq Faruqui told Prothom Alo that he was taking part in the hearing and the dock was at a distance from there. There were many lawyers in the court and he had not spotted the matter of Dipu Moni writing a letter. If he had seen it, he would certainly have brought the matter to the court’s attention. After all, an accused is in custody of the court and cannot speak to anyone other than his or her lawyer. Speaking to Prothom Alo, Dipu Moni’s lawyer Gazi Faisal Islam told Prothom Alo that he had not seen his client write any such letter as the court was crowded and he had been in the front of the court, busy with the hearing. The court ordered Dipu Moni to be shown arrested in two murder cases at the Jatrabari police station and sent to jail. It was seen in court that when Anisul Huq was brought into the court room, he held his two hands in front. He stood gloomily in the dock. He only spoke for some time with his lawyer. After that he stood silent in the dock. Salman F Rahman was by his side but he did not talk to him. Former IGPs Shahidul Huq and Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun stood close by Anisul Huq. They spoke to each other for 5-10 minutes. Rashed Khan Menon was on one side of the dock and standing at a distance from him was Hasanul Haque Inu. They did not speak to each other. They spoke to their lawyers. After the hearing, the court granted permission to take Anisul Huq, Salman F Rahman, Hasanul Haque Inu, Rashed Khan Menon and Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun on remand for a varying number of days. Also, Zunaid Ahmed, Fazle Karim Chowdhury and Shahidul Huq were shown arrested in various cases."
"A lost chapter in Bangladesh-Pakistan diplomacy","Bangladesh’s diplomacy is like an old-fashioned wall clock with a pendulum, swinging back and forth. For the past one and a half decades, it had tilted to one side, but now it may be time for a change in direction. In the recent past, relations with many countries were unusually ""good,"" while with others, they deteriorated. Now, efforts are underway to correct these ""abnormal"" chapters. At this time, efforts are also being made to revive the lost communication in the bilateral relationship between Bangladesh and Pakistan. There has been an increase in conversations between diplomats and politicians of both countries. 2024 marks the 50th anniversary of mutual recognition between Bangladesh and Pakistan. This moment is quite a celebratory one. At such a ""favorable moment,"" as efforts are being made to rebuild the relationship, a natural question arises: will the old sensitive issue of Bangladesh's outstanding dues with Pakistan be settled? This is a fundamental unresolved issue in their relationship. European countries have been functioning together in a union for 31 years. Unfortunately, the countries of South Asia have had a different experience. They initially separated into several entities and have not been able to form a union like the EU, nor have they managed to maintain even normal bilateral relations in many cases. Even a small conflict leads to the imposition of stricter visa policies on each other’s citizens. Due to such ""teenage"" mentality, expected commercial and cultural relations have not progressed. The Bangladesh-Pakistan relationship has suffered from similar misfortune. Pakistan’s export business with Bangladesh is less than $100 million, and only one-five-hundredth of Bangladesh’s total exports goes to Pakistan. Though Pakistan is somewhat ahead in this regard, high tariffs from Bangladesh have made it difficult for Pakistani goods to enter the country. Over the years, the flow of goods from Pakistan has been closely monitored as a political decision. For a long time, there have been no direct flights from Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) to Dhaka. Such a situation clearly needs to change. Together, both countries represent a market of over 400 million people. Normal diplomatic relations could open up significant opportunities for both nations. Pakistan could become a good market for Bangladesh's products, ranging from raw jute to pharmaceuticals. Recently, business chambers from both countries have formed a new council to increase trade. However, it is difficult for businessmen alone to smoothen interstate relations; only politicians can do that. To move forward, Bangladesh and Pakistan must address their old debts and unresolved issues. A significant obstacle in the past was the issue of Urdu-speaking people stranded in Bangladesh. Since Bangladesh granted them voting rights, Pakistan is now somewhat freed from this responsibility. The government of Dhaka has shown considerable generosity on this matter, and today’s Urdu-speaking generation is less inclined to move to Pakistan. Another unresolved issue concerns the division of post-independence resources. Although this issue hasn’t been discussed for a long time, it will need resolution to move the relationship forward. From Bangladesh’s perspective, the people have a legitimate claim to these resources, and no policymaker can ignore this demand. Pakistan and Bangladesh were united for 24 years. After their separation, the division of economic responsibilities naturally arose. These include sharing foreign assets, the foreign currency held in Bangladesh before the war, the surplus generated from exports and imports during the period of East Pakistan, and the receipt and repayment of foreign debts. There is also the matter of compensations for the war victims. However, due to the political emotions and tensions following 1971, this crucial task was not carried out dispassionately and remains unresolved. Although 54 years have passed, it is a matter that the leaders of both countries must resolve in one way or another. There are many precedents in international law regarding the division of state legacy after partition, the birth of new states, or the unification of two regions. Bangladesh and Pakistan can take guidance from these conventions to reach a satisfactory resolution on this disputed issue. In December, during the D-8 summit in Egypt, Bangladesh's interim government’s chief advisor, professor Muhammad Yunus, met with Pakistan’s prime minister Shahbaz Sharif. He appropriately mentioned that “old issues keep resurfacing, and to move forward, the unresolved matters must be settled, especially for the sake of future generations.” They had met earlier during the UN General Assembly as well. During Nawaz Sharif’s tenure in the past, Pakistan showed the most positive attitude toward bilateral issues. In this light, it can be said that now is a good moment for both countries to move forward in their relations. This is also an opportunity. Since independence, many Bangladeshi politicians and intellectuals have called for the settlement of old debts. During the war, Pakistan had reserves of about $4.25 billion, part of which many have claimed should be Bangladesh's share. In 1972, then prime minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman raised claims on this issue. During Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s visit in 1974, formal discussions on these debts took place, with Bangladesh presenting a claim for $4 billion.Later, Bhutto suggested that Bangladesh should also share the foreign debts from before 1971. Even though this was a negative approach, it acknowledged the rationale behind the division of assets, and Bangladesh agreed to take on a part of undivided Pakistan’s foreign debt, amounting to around $360 million. Under pressure from creditors, Bangladesh agreed to this decision. Bangladesh was positive from the beginning about advancing relations with Pakistan. However, Bangladesh’s acceptance of foreign debt from undivided Pakistan was related to the financial division at that time, and a resolution would need to come in a package. Although discussions on debts were halted after 1975, in 1978, Shamsul Haq, the foreign minister of Ziaur Rahman’s government, also raised the matter. While the Pakistani government initially remained silent on this issue, later Pakistan’s businessmen began raising concerns about compensating for their abandoned businesses in Bangladesh. This added complexity to the issue of state legacy. However, there are many elements worth listening to in the views of Pakistan’s industrialists and businessmen. The Bangladeshi government later took some corrective actions in response. But the Pakistani government has always been unwilling and unclear in addressing the state legacy of debts, and at times has used the issue of assets abandoned during the war to deflect attention from the matter. Such conflicting claims are an obstacle to healthy bilateral relations. What is needed is a solution where both sides can make concessions and receive something in return. Expectations are high that Pakistan’s foreign minister’s upcoming visit to Bangladesh will lead to positive progress on this matter. It is true that after the war, many industrial assets of West Pakistan were nationalised in Bangladesh. The Karachi Stock Exchange later made a record of these industries. For such assets, there is a need for extensive research to determine whether the post-war government in Bangladesh managed these properties correctly, how they were distributed, and where these assets are now. For many, this may seem like opening a Pandora’s Box, but avoiding the responsibilities of history is truly difficult. What could have started in 1972, is still an issue that cannot be avoided in 2025. At least, if relations with Pakistan are to progress, these matters will inevitably come to the fore. Even if governments try to avoid them, questions may be raised by non-governmental entities, and if avoided entirely, they could emerge in international forums. In the past, the return of Urdu-speaking people and the issue of war crimes overshadowed Bangladesh-Pakistan bilateral talks. Now that Bangladesh is handling the issue of Urdu speakers on its own terms, Pakistan may come up with positive proposals regarding the settlement of debts. Even if both countries feel embarrassed to discuss these matters directly, they could seek technical assistance from the UN or the OIC. Such initiatives would speed up potential commercial, diplomatic, and geopolitical cooperation. However, current efforts to normalize relations should not be held back by the division of debts. Bangladesh has already taken steps to import 50,000 metric tons of rice from Pakistan, among other goods, signaling an expansion of bilateral ties. Nevertheless, any normal relationship requires a transparent understanding of past wrongs. The future’s sustainability depends on past justice. In particular, the international assistance sent to East Pakistan during the November 1970 cyclone, which was not distributed due to the outbreak of war four months later (amounting to nearly $200 million), could serve as an immediate and inspiring precedent for Pakistan. In recent history, relations couldn't be continued even after elevating bilateral relations with India to great heights due to the unresolved Teesta water-sharing issue. Unresolved economic issues from before 1971 will inevitably resurface in the Bangladesh-Pakistan relationship. People might even wonder: if water-sharing can become an international issue, why not economic debts? **Altaf Parvez is a researcher on history **This column appeared in the print and online edition of Prothom Alo and has been rewritten for the English edition by Rabiul Islam"
"Medical admission postponed for candidates passed under quota, docs to be scrutinised","The documents of children of freedom fighters and underprivileged communities who passed the MBBS admission test under quota facilities for the 2024-25 education session will be scrutinised. If any of their information are found to be incorrect, their primary selection will be cancelled, the Directorate General of Medical Education (DGME) said on Monday. The admission procedure for the 193 students passed under the quota facilities will remain postponed until the completion of this scrutiny. However, the activities will continue for all other candidates. As per the provisions, there is a 5 per cent quota for the children of freedom fighters, martyred freedom fighters and Birangonas (war heroines). Besides, there is a 5 per cent reservation for the underprivileged communities. The MBBS admission test results were published on Sunday. But the students of several medical colleges, including the Dhaka Medical College, and university students have been staging demonstrations for the last two days, demanding republishing the results, scrapping the MBBS admission test results published on Sunday, and to do away with the quota system in the medical admission test. They submitted a memo for Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus around 3:00 pm today, Monday. They demanded the medical admission test results to be cancelled by 8:00 pm today and republish it. In this context, a notification of DGME today said their policy states that the documents of candidates passed under the quota facilities for the freedom fighters, martyred freedom fighters, war heroines and underprivileged communities will be scrutinised by the by the central admission committee and the admission process, subject to permission, will have to be completed. The candidates passed under the quota facilities for the underprivileged communities have been asked to remain present at the DGME with necessary documents on 23 and 26 January. Besides, the candidates passed under the quota facilities for the freedom fighters, martyred freedom fighters, and war heroines have been asked to show their documents at the DGME on 27, 28 and 29 January. DGME’s additional director general (medical education) Professor Rubina Yasmin told Prothom Alo the policy states about a 5 per cent quota for the children of freedom fighters, martyred freedom fighters, and war heroines. There will be none under this quota if the government takes a decision that this quota will no longer be in place. She further said, if the government decides to retain the quota, then the children of freedom fighters, martyred freedom fighters, and war heroines with valid documents will be selected. The remaining seats will be filled from the merit list."
